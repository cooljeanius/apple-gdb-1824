This is a plaintext file that contains a list of past versions of
apple-gdb which were the last versions to contain certain files. I have
tried to copy files from these older versions into this distribution when
relevant. Feel free to add to this list if you are able to narrow down
the last appearances of other files. (This would be so much easier if
Apple would just open up their VCS to us... their *real* VCS, that is;
the apple-oss-distributions organization on GitHub is just based on
the tarballs that they have released publicly...)

	- 186.1: first version available

	- 213: last version with src/gdb-next (most of this was transferred
	to src/gdb/macosx, but not all of it...)

	- 250: last version with src/gdb/29k-share and some other things in
	src/gdb...

	- 282: first version with src/utils (unfortunately Apple decided to
	add it after amd-udi had already been deprecated upstream...)

	- 309: last version with src/contrib, src/etc, src/expect, src/sim,
	src/tcl, src/texinfo, src/utils, and maybe a few other things...

	- 356: last version with a toplevel dpkg directory and toplevel
	ntbuild scripts

	- 437: last version with src/mmalloc, src/mpw*, and a few other
	things

	- 967: last version with libcheckpoint

	- 1705: last version where option to use included regex works

	- 1824: most recent version available as of November 2013

	- 2831: technically a more recent version, but it was released
	after I had already started, and mostly just removes stuff, so
	I am mostly just ignoring it...

# Versioning scheme and stuff comes from:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/tarballs/gdb/
and
http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/gdb/

Apple also has a separate directory for binutils, which I think was the
precursor to their gdb sources (the files in them are very similar).
Anyways, that is:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/tarballs/binutils/
and
http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/binutils/

These directories have their own special versions:

	- binutils-36: last version with actual files in src/electric-fence

There is also a separate directory for gdb for CodeWarrior:
http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/gdbforcw/
and
http://opensource.apple.com/source/gdbforcw/
The releases of gdbforcw correspond to releases missing from the main
gdb-apple releases, which would all fall between gdb-437 and gdb-477:

	- gdbforcw-1 = gdb-439

	- gdbforcw-3.2 = gdb-441.2

	- gdbforcw-5 = gdb-443

	- gdbforcw-6 = gdb-444
