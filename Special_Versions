This file contains a list of past versions of apple-gdb which were the
last versions to contain certain files. I have tried to copy files from
these older versions into this distribution when relevant. Feel free to
add to this list if you are able to narrow down the last appearances of
other files. (This would be so much easier if Apple would just open up
their VCS to us... or maybe it is open but just hidden? idk...)

	- 186.1: first version available

	- 213: last version with src/gdb-next (most of this was transferred
	to src/gdb/macosx, but not all of it...)

	- 250: last version with src/gdb/29k-share and some other things in
	src/gdb...

	- 282: first version with src/utils (unfortunately Apple decided to
	add it after amd-udi had already been deprecated upstream...)

	- 309: last version with src/contrib, src/etc, src/expect, src/sim,
	src/tcl, src/texinfo, src/utils, and maybe a few other things...

	- 356: last version with a toplevel dpkg directory and toplevel
	ntbuild scripts

	- 437: last version with src/mmalloc, src/mpw*, and a few other
	things

	- 967: last version with libcheckpoint

	- 1824: most recent version available as of November 2013

# Versioning scheme and stuff comes from:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/tarballs/gdb/
and
http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/gdb/

Apple also has a separate directory for binutils, which I think was the
precursor to their gdb sources (the files in them are very similar).
Anyways, that is:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/tarballs/binutils/
and
http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/binutils/

These directories have their own special versions:

	- binutils-36: last version with actual files in src/electric-fence

There is also a separate directory for gdb for CodeWarrior:
http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/gdbforcw/
and
http://opensource.apple.com/source/gdbforcw/
I cannot tell the difference between it and the main Apple gdb sources
though.
