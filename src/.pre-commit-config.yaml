# Git has the notion of hooks, which are custom scripts that are run on
# specific events.  One of these hooks is the pre-commit hook (located at
# .git/hooks/pre-commit), which is run when committing, before specifying a
# message.
#
# To ease management of the pre-commit hook, the pre-commit framework
# (<https://pre-commit.com>) was developed.  This is the configuration file
# for that framework.  It contains a list of hooks, with information on where
# to find them and on which files to run them.
#
# See here (<https://pre-commit.com/#install>) on how to install the
# pre-commit framework.
#
# To run all the hooks specified in this file manually, you can do:
# $ pre-commit run
#
# To run some hooks and skip others, you can use environment variable SKIP:
# $ SKIP=flake8,isort pre-commit run
#
# To install the pre-commit framework in the repository in order to run the
# hooks on every commit, do:
# $ pre-commit install
#
# After installing the pre-commit framework, you can skip running all
# pre-commit hooks using --no-verify, or some using SKIP.
# $ git commit --no-verify ...
# $ SKIP=flake8,isort git commit ...
#
# In case some of these hooks don't work for you, you can make the SKIP
# setting permanent by:
# - setting SKIP in your environment
#   (this will affect all repositories where it is set)
# - setting SKIP in .git/hooks/pre-commit by adding "export SKIP=..."
#   (this will affect only this repository, but it may have to be re-added
#    if .git/hooks/pre-commit is regenerated)
#
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information
# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
