#TODO: I am on a different machine now, and my gitignored copies of
# the broken directories that I was working on are now gone... do I start
# afresh from the last versions to appear in apple-gdb (309), which is what
# I started from last time, or do I start afresh from the latest
# FSF versions this time?
