	GNU AutoGen/AutoOpts is a two-part project that serves two separate
	purposes.  The two parts are combined because they are inextricably
	intertwined:

	AutoGen is a tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of
	programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.  It is
	especially valuable in programs that have several blocks of text that
	must be kept synchronized.

	AutoOpts is both an example of that and a project in its own right.
	It is a very powerful configuration file, environment variable and
	command line option documentation and management tool consisting of a
	set of AutoGen templates and a run time library that nearly eliminates
	the hassle of managing, parsing and documenting program options.

	The self-referential example:
	http://www.gnu.org/software/${project}/man1-autogen.html

	There are several other examples embedded in AutoGen:
	A finite state machine generator, string name to enumeration value
	conversions, and bit map and bit mask management, to name a few.
