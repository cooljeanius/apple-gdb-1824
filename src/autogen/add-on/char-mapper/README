DESCRIPTION:

Construct a character classification table and a collection of macros
to test a character's classification.

PURPOSE:

   This program will take a list of character classes and convert them
   into bit map tests.  If all you ever need are "isspace" or "isalpha"
   or the other tests included in <ctype.h>, then by all means use that.
   On the other hand, if you find yourself writing code like:
      if (isalnum(*p) || (*p == '_'))
   Then this might be handy.

EXAMPLE:

Here is a short example:

    lower-case      "a-z"
    upper-case      "A-Z"
    alphabetic      +lower-case   +upper-case
    unquotable      "!-~"         -"\"#(),;<=>[\\]`{}?*'"
    oct-digit       "0-7"
    dec-digit       "89"          +oct-digit
    hex-digit       "a-fA-F"      +dec-digit

The syntax is: class-name [ literal-string ] [{+|-}another-class]...
If a literal string is specified, then a new test bit is added.
If a character class is named, its bits are included or removed
from the character class set.  If a class does not have a literal
string specified, then you cannot remove members.  Only the literal
members of a class can be removed from that class.

This table produces these (among other) macros for each character class,
plus a hidden array of 128 mask values:

#define  IS_LOWER_CASE_CHAR( _c)       is_ag_char_map_char((char)( _c), 0x000001)
#define SPN_LOWER_CASE_CHARS(_s)      spn_ag_char_map_chars((char *)_s, 0x000001)
#define BRK_LOWER_CASE_CHARS(_s)      brk_ag_char_map_chars((char *)_s, 0x000001)

and the code to scan over a valid variable name, for example,
looks like this:

   if (IS_VAR_FIRST_CHAR(*p)) {
      end = SPN_VARIABLE_NAME_CHARS(p);

"spn" and "brk" return pointers to the next (non-)matching character.
They do not return character counts.

If "%backup" is specified, two backup spanner macros are also created:

#define SPN_LOWER_CASE_BACK(s,e)         \
        spn_ag_char_map_back((char *)s, (char *)e, 0x0000001)
#define BRK_LOWER_CASE_BACK(s,e)         \
        brk_ag_char_map_back((char *)s, (char *)e, 0x0000001)

where the "s" points to the start of the string and "e" points
to either the start or one character past the end of the string.
If they are equal, the "e" pointer is advanced to the end of
the string.
