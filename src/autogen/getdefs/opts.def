	_EOF_;

prog_descrip = <<_EOF_
This program extracts AutoGen definitions from a list of source files.
Definitions are delimited by @code{/*=<entry-type> <entry-name>\n} and
@code{=*/\n}.  From that, this program creates a definition of the following
form:

@example
    #line nnn "source-file-name"
    entry_type = @{
        name = entry_name;
        ...
    @};
@end example

@enumerate
@item
The ellipsis @code{...} is filled in by text found between the two
delimiters.  Each line of text is stripped of anything before the first
asterisk, then leading asterisks, then any leading or trailing white space.

@item
If what is left starts with what looks like a name followed by a colon, then
it is interpreted as a name followed by a value.

@item
If the first character of the value is either a single or double quote, then
you are responsible for quoting the text as it gets inserted into the output
definitions.  So, if you want whitespace at the beginnings of the lines of
text, you must do something like this:

@example
 * mumble:
 * "  this is some\n"
 * "  indented text."
@end example

@item
If the @code{<entry-name>} is followed by a comma, the word @code{ifdef} (or
@code{ifndef}) and a name @code{if_name}, then the above entry will be under
@code{ifdef} control.

@example
/*=group entry_name, ifdef FOO
 * attr: attribute value
=*/
@end example

Will produce the following:

@example
#ifdef FOO
#line nnn "source-file-name"
group = @{
    name = entry_name;
    attr = 'attribute value';
@};
#endif
@end example

@item
If you use of the @code{subblock} option, you can specify a nested
value, @xref{getdefs subblock}.  That is, this text:

@example
 * arg:  int, this, what-it-is
@end example

with the @code{--subblock=arg=type,name,doc} option would yield:

@example
arg = @{ type = int; name = this; doc = what-it-is; @};
@end example
@end enumerate
_EOF_;
