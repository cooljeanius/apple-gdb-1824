1 Introduction
**************

AutoGen is a tool designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.  Its goal is to simplify the
maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
This is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text
that must be kept synchronized in parallel tables.

   An obvious example is the problem of maintaining the code required
for processing program options and configuration settings.  Processing
options requires a minimum of four different constructs be kept in
proper order in different places in your program.  You need at least:

  1. The flag character in the flag string,

  2. code to process the flag when it is encountered,

  3. a global state variable or two, and

  4. a line in the usage text.

You will need more things besides this if you choose to implement long
option names, configuration (rc/ini) file processing, environment
variable settings and keep all the documentation for these up to date.
This can be done mechanically; with the proper templates and this
program.  In fact, it has already been done and AutoGen itself uses it

ridiculously extensive.

1.1 The Purpose of AutoGen
==========================

The idea of this program is to have a text file, a template if you
will, that contains the general text of the desired output file.  That
file includes substitution expressions and sections of text that are
replicated under the control of separate definition files.

   AutoGen was designed with the following features:

  1. The definitions are completely separate from the template.  By
     completely isolating the definitions from the template it greatly
     increases the flexibility of the template implementation.  A
     secondary goal is that a template user only needs to specify those
     data that are necessary to describe his application of a template.

  2. Each datum in the definitions is named.  Thus, the definitions can
     be rearranged, augmented and become obsolete without it being
     necessary to go back and clean up older definition files.  Reduce
     incompatibilities!

  3. Every definition name defines an array of values, even when there
     is only one entry.  These arrays of values are used to control the
     replication of sections of the template.

  4. There are named collections of definitions.  They form a nested
     hierarchy.  Associated values are collected and associated with a
     group name.  These associated data are used collectively in sets
     of substitutions.

  5. The template has special markers to indicate where substitutions
     are required, much like the `${VAR}' construct in a shell `here
     doc'.  These markers are not fixed strings.  They are specified at
     the start of each template.  Template designers know best what
     fits into their syntax and can avoid marker conflicts.

     We did this because it is burdensome and difficult to avoid
     conflicts using either M4 tokenization or C preprocessor
     substitution rules.  It also makes it easier to specify
     expressions that transform the value.  Of course, our expressions
     are less cryptic than the shell methods.

  6. These same markers are used, in conjunction with enclosed
     keywords, to indicate sections of text that are to be skipped and
     for sections of text that are to be repeated.  This is a major
     improvement over using C preprocessing macros.  With the C
     preprocessor, you have no way of selecting output text because it
     is an unvarying, mechanical substitution process.

  7. Finally, we supply methods for carefully controlling the output.
     Sometimes, it is just simply easier and clearer to compute some
     text or a value in one context when its application needs to be
     later.  So, functions are available for saving text or values for
     later use.


File: autogen.info,  Node: Example Usage,  Next: csh/zsh caveat,  Prev: Generalities,  Up: Introduction

1.2 A Simple Example
====================

This is just one simple example that shows a few basic features.  If
you are interested, you also may run "make check" with the `VERBOSE'
environment variable set and see a number of other examples in the
`agen5/test/testdir' directory.

   Assume you have an enumeration of names and you wish to associate
some string with each name.  Assume also, for the sake of this example,
that it is either too complex or too large to maintain easily by hand.
We will start by writing an abbreviated version of what the result is
supposed to be.  We will use that to construct our output templates.

In a header file, `list.h', you define the enumeration and the global
array containing the associated strings:

     typedef enum {
             IDX_ALPHA,
             IDX_BETA,
             IDX_OMEGA }  list_enum;

     extern char const* az_name_list[ 3 ];

Then you also have `list.c' that defines the actual strings:

     #include "list.h"
     char const* az_name_list[] = {
             "some alpha stuff",
             "more beta stuff",
             "final omega stuff" };

First, we will define the information that is unique for each
enumeration name/string pair.  This would be placed in a file named,
`list.def', for example.

     autogen definitions list;
     list = { list_element = alpha;
              list_info    = "some alpha stuff"; };
     list = { list_info    = "more beta stuff";
              list_element = beta; };
     list = { list_element = omega;
              list_info    = "final omega stuff"; };

   The `autogen definitions list;' entry defines the file as an AutoGen
definition file that uses a template named `list'.  That is followed by
three `list' entries that define the associations between the
enumeration names and the strings.  The order of the differently named
elements inside of list is unimportant.  They are reversed inside of the
`beta' entry and the output is unaffected.

   Now, to actually create the output, we need a template or two that
can be expanded into the files you want.  In this program, we use a
single template that is capable of multiple output files.  The
definitions above refer to a `list' template, so it would normally be
named, `list.tpl'.

   It looks something like this.  (For a full description, *Note
Template File::.)

     [+ AutoGen5 template h c +]
     [+ CASE (suffix) +][+
        ==  h  +]
     typedef enum {[+
        FOR list "," +]
             IDX_[+ (string-upcase! (get "list_element")) +][+
        ENDFOR list +] }  list_enum;

     extern char const* az_name_list[ [+ (count "list") +] ];
     [+

        ==  c  +]
     #include "list.h"
     char const* az_name_list[] = {[+
       FOR list "," +]
             "[+list_info+]"[+
       ENDFOR list +] };[+

     ESAC +]

   The `[+ AutoGen5 template h c +]' text tells AutoGen that this is an
AutoGen version 5 template file; that it is to be processed twice; that
the start macro marker is `[+'; and the end marker is `+]'.  The
template will be processed first with a suffix value of `h' and then
with `c'.  Normally, the suffix values are appended to the `base-name'
to create the output file name.

   The `[+ == h +]' and `[+ == c +]' `CASE' selection clauses select
different text for the two different passes.  In this example, the
output is nearly disjoint and could have been put in two separate
templates.  However, sometimes there are common sections and this is
just an example.

   The `[+FOR list "," +]' and `[+ ENDFOR list +]' clauses delimit a
block of text that will be repeated for every definition of `list'.
Inside of that block, the definition name-value pairs that are members
of each `list' are available for substitutions.

   The remainder of the macros are expressions.  Some of these contain
special expression functions that are dependent on AutoGen named values;
others are simply Scheme expressions, the result of which will be
inserted into the output text.  Other expressions are names of AutoGen
values.  These values will be inserted into the output text.  For
example, `[+list_info+]' will result in the value associated with the
name `list_info' being inserted between the double quotes and
`(string-upcase! (get "list_element"))' will first "get" the value
associated with the name `list_element', then change the case of all
the letters to upper case.  The result will be inserted into the output
document.

   If you have compiled AutoGen, you can copy out the template and
definitions as described above and run `autogen list.def'.  This will
produce exactly the hypothesized desired output.

   One more point, too.  Lets say you decided it was too much trouble
to figure out how to use AutoGen, so you created this enumeration and
string list with thousands of entries.  Now, requirements have changed
and it has become necessary to map a string containing the enumeration
name into the enumeration number.  With AutoGen, you just alter the
template to emit the table of names.  It will be guaranteed to be in
the correct order, missing none of the entries.  If you want to do that
by hand, well, good luck.

1.3 csh/zsh caveat
==================

AutoGen tries to use your normal shell so that you can supply shell code
in a manner you are accustomed to using.  If, however, you use csh or
zsh, you cannot do this.  Csh is sufficiently difficult to program that
it is unsupported.  Zsh, though largely programmable, also has some
anomalies that make it incompatible with AutoGen usage.  Therefore, when
invoking AutoGen from these environments, you must be certain to set the
SHELL environment variable to a Bourne-derived shell, e.g., sh, ksh or
bash.

   Any shell you choose for your own scripts need to follow these basic
requirements:

  1. It handles `trap ":" $sig' without output to standard out.  This
     is done when the server shell is first started.  If your shell
     does not handle this, then it may be able to by loading functions
     from its start up files.

  2. At the beginning of each scriptlet, the command `\\cd $PWD' is
     inserted.  This ensures that `cd' is not aliased to something
     peculiar and each scriptlet starts life in the execution directory.

  3. At the end of each scriptlet, the command `echo mumble' is
     appended.  The program you use as a shell must emit the single
     argument `mumble' on a line by itself.

1.4 A User's Perspective
========================

Alexandre wrote:

   I am using AutoGen in my pet project, and find one of its best
points to be that it separates the operational data from the
implementation.

   Indulge me for a few paragraphs, and all will be revealed: In the
manual, Bruce cites the example of maintaining command line flags
inside the source code; traditionally spreading usage information, flag
names, letters and processing across several functions (if not files).
Investing the time in writing a sort of boiler plate (a template in
AutoGen terminology) pays by moving all of the option details (usage,
flags names etc.) into a well structured table (a definition file if you
will),  so that adding a new command line option becomes a simple matter
of adding a set of details to the table.

   So far so good!  Of course, now that there is a template, writing
all of that tedious optargs processing and usage functions is no longer
an issue.  Creating a table of the options needed for the new project
and running AutoGen generates all of the option processing code in C
automatically from just the tabular data.  AutoGen in fact already ships
with such a template... AutoOpts.

   One final consequence of the good separation in the design of
AutoGen is that it is retargetable to a greater extent.  The
egcs/gcc/fixinc/inclhack.def can equally be used (with different
templates) to create a shell script (inclhack.sh) or a c program
(fixincl.c).

   This is just the tip of the iceberg.  AutoGen is far more powerful
than these examples might indicate, and has many other varied uses.  I
am certain Bruce or I could supply you with many and varied examples,
and I would heartily recommend that you try it for your project and see
for yourself how it compares to m4.  

   As an aside, I would be interested to see whether someone might be
persuaded to rationalise autoconf with AutoGen in place of m4...  Ben,
are you listening?  autoconf-3.0! `kay?  =)O|

2 Definitions File
******************

This chapter describes the syntax and semantics of the AutoGen
definition file.  In order to instantiate a template, you normally must
provide a definitions file that identifies itself and contains some
value definitions.  Consequently, we keep it very simple.  For
"advanced" users, there are preprocessing directives, sparse arrays,
named indexes and comments that may be used as well.

   The definitions file is used to associate values with names.  Every
value is implicitly an array of values, even if there is only one value.
Values may be either simple strings or compound collections of
name-value pairs.  An array may not contain both simple and compound
members.  Fundamentally, it is as simple as:

     prog-name = "autogen";
     flag = {
         name      = templ_dirs;
         value     = L;
         descrip   = "Template search directory list";
     };

   For purposes of commenting and controlling the processing of the
definitions, C-style comments and most C preprocessing directives are
honored.  The major exception is that the `#if' directive is ignored,
along with all following text through the matching `#endif' directive.
The C preprocessor is not actually invoked, so C macro substitution is
*not* performed.

File: autogen.info,  Node: Identification,  Next: Definitions,  Up: Definitions File

2.1 The Identification Definition
=================================

The first definition in this file is used to identify it as a AutoGen
file.  It consists of the two keywords, `autogen' and `definitions'
followed by the default template name and a terminating semi-colon
(`;').  That is:

             AutoGen Definitions TEMPLATE-NAME;

Note that, other than the name TEMPLATE-NAME, the words `AutoGen' and
`Definitions' are searched for without case sensitivity.  Most lookups
in this program are case insensitive.

Also, if the input contains more identification definitions, they will
be ignored.  This is done so that you may include (*note Directives::)
other definition files without an identification conflict.

AutoGen uses the name of the template to find the corresponding template
file.  It searches for the file in the following way, stopping when it
finds the file:

  1. It tries to open `./TEMPLATE-NAME'.  If it fails,

  2. it tries `./TEMPLATE-NAME.tpl'.

  3. It searches for either of these files in the directories listed in
     the templ-dirs command line option.

   If AutoGen fails to find the template file in one of these places,
it prints an error message and exits.


File: autogen.info,  Node: Definitions,  Next: Index Assignments,  Prev: Identification,  Up: Definitions File

2.2 Named Definitions
=====================

A name is a sequence of characters beginning with an alphabetic
character (`a' through `z') followed by zero or more alpha-numeric
characters and/or separator characters: hyphen (`-'), underscore (`_')
or carat (`^').  Names are case insensitive.

   Any name may have multiple values associated with it.  Every name
may be considered a sparse array of one or more elements.  If there is
more than one value, the values my be accessed by indexing the value
with `[index]' or by iterating over them using the FOR (*note FOR::)
AutoGen macro on it, as described in the next chapter.  Sparse arrays
are specified by specifying an index when defining an entry (*note
Assigning an Index to a Definition: Index Assignments.).

   There are two kinds of definitions, `simple' and `compound'.  They
are defined thus (*note Full Syntax::):

     compound_name '=' '{' definition-list '}' ';'

     simple-name[2] '=' string ';'

     no^text^name ';'

`simple-name' has the third index (index number 2) defined here.
`No^text^name' is a simple definition with a shorthand empty string
value.  The string values for definitions may be specified in any of
several formation rules.

File: autogen.info,  Node: def-list,  Next: double-quote-string,  Up: Definitions

2.2.1 Definition List
---------------------

`definition-list' is a list of definitions that may or may not contain
nested compound definitions.  Any such definitions may *only* be
expanded within a `FOR' block iterating over the containing compound
definition.  *Note FOR::.

   Here is, again, the example definitions from the previous chapter,
with three additional name value pairs.  Two with an empty value
assigned (FIRST and LAST), and a "global" GROUP_NAME.

     autogen definitions list;
     group_name = example;
     list = { list_element = alpha;  first;
              list_info    = "some alpha stuff"; };
     list = { list_info    = "more beta stuff";
              list_element = beta; };
     list = { list_element = omega;  last;
              list_info    = "final omega stuff"; };


File: autogen.info,  Node: double-quote-string,  Next: single-quote-string,  Prev: def-list,  Up: Definitions

2.2.2 Double Quote String
-------------------------

The string follows the C-style escaping, using the backslash to quote
(escape) the following character(s).  Certain letters are translated to
various control codes (e.g. `\n', `\f', `\t', etc.).  `x' introduces a
two character hex code.  `0' (the digit zero) introduces a one to three
character octal code (note: an octal byte followed by a digit must be
represented with three octal digits, thus: `"\0001"' yielding a NUL
byte followed by the ASCII digit 1).  Any other character following the
backslash escape is simply inserted, without error, into the string
being formed.

   Like ANSI "C", a series of these strings, possibly intermixed with
single quote strings, will be concatenated together.


File: autogen.info,  Node: single-quote-string,  Next: simple-string,  Prev: double-quote-string,  Up: Definitions

2.2.3 Single Quote String
-------------------------

This is similar to the shell single-quote string.  However, escapes `\'
are honored before another escape, single quotes `'' and hash
characters `#'.  This latter is done specifically to disambiguate lines
starting with a hash character inside of a quoted string.  In other
words,

     fumble = '
     #endif
     ';

   could be misinterpreted by the definitions scanner, whereas this
would not:

     fumble = '
     \#endif
     ';

As with the double quote string, a series of these, even intermixed
with double quote strings, will be concatenated together.


File: autogen.info,  Node: simple-string,  Next: shell-generated,  Prev: single-quote-string,  Up: Definitions

2.2.4 An Unquoted String
------------------------

A simple string that does not contain white space may be left unquoted.
The string must not contain any of the characters special to the
definition text (i.e., `"', `#', `'', `(', `)', `,', `;', `<', `=',
`>', `[', `]', ``', `{', or `}').  This list is subject to change, but
it will never contain underscore (`_'), period (`.'), slash (`/'),
colon (`:'), hyphen (`-') or backslash (`\\').  Basically, if the
string looks like it is a normal DOS or UNIX file or variable name, and
it is not one of two keywords (`autogen' or `definitions') then it is
OK to not quote it, otherwise you should.


File: autogen.info,  Node: shell-generated,  Next: scheme-generated,  Prev: simple-string,  Up: Definitions

2.2.5 Shell Output String
-------------------------

This is assembled according to the same rules as the double quote
string, except that there is no concatenation of strings and the
resulting string is written to a shell server process.  The definition
takes on the value of the output string.

   NB The text is interpreted by a server shell.  There may be left over
state from previous server shell processing.  This scriptlet may also
leave state for subsequent processing.  However, a `cd' to the original
directory is always issued before the new command is issued.


File: autogen.info,  Node: scheme-generated,  Next: here-string,  Prev: shell-generated,  Up: Definitions

2.2.6 Scheme Result String
--------------------------

A scheme result string must begin with an open parenthesis `('.  The
scheme expression will be evaluated by Guile and the value will be the
result.  The AutoGen expression functions are *dis*abled at this stage,
so do not use them.


File: autogen.info,  Node: here-string,  Next: concat-string,  Prev: scheme-generated,  Up: Definitions

2.2.7 A Here String
-------------------

A `here string' is formed in much the same way as a shell here doc.  It
is denoted with two less than characters(`<<') and, optionally, a
hyphen.  This is followed by optional horizontal white space and an
ending marker-identifier.  This marker must follow the syntax rules for
identifiers.  Unlike the shell version, however, you must not quote
this marker.

   The resulting string will start with the first character on the next
line and continue up to but not including the newline that precedes the
line that begins with the marker token.  If a hyphen follows the less
than characters, then leading tabs will be stripped and the terminating
marker will be recognized even if preceded by tabs.  No backslash or
any other kind of processing is done on this string.  The characters
are copied directly into the result string.

   Here are two examples:
     str1 = <<-  STR_END
             $quotes = " ' `
             STR_END;

     str2 = <<   STR_END
             $quotes = " ' `
             STR_END;
     STR_END;
   The first string contains no new line characters.  The first
character is the dollar sign, the last the back quote.

   The second string contains one new line character.  The first
character is the tab character preceding the dollar sign.  The last
character is the semicolon after the `STR_END'.  That `STR_END' does not
end the string because it is not at the beginning of the line.  In the
preceding case, the leading tab was stripped.


File: autogen.info,  Node: concat-string,  Prev: here-string,  Up: Definitions

2.2.8 Concatenated Strings
--------------------------

If single or double quote characters are used, then you also have the
option, a la ANSI-C syntax, of implicitly concatenating a series of
them together, with intervening white space ignored.

   NB  You *cannot* use directives to alter the string content.  That
is,

     str = "fumble"
     #ifdef LATER
           "stumble"
     #endif
           ;

will result in a syntax error.  The preprocessing directives are not
carried out by the C preprocessor.  However,

     str = '"fumble\n"
     #ifdef LATER
     "     stumble\n"
     #endif
     ';

*Will* work.  It will enclose the `#ifdef LATER' and `#endif' in the
string.  But it may also wreak havoc with the definition processing
directives.  The hash characters in the first column should be
disambiguated with an escape `\' or join them with previous lines:
`"fumble\n#ifdef LATER...'.

2.3 Assigning an Index to a Definition
======================================

In AutoGen, every name is implicitly an array of values.  When
assigning values, they are usually implicitly assigned to the next
highest slot.  They can also be specified explicitly:

     mumble[9] = stumble;
     mumble[0] = grumble;

If, subsequently, you assign a value to `mumble' without an index, its
index will be `10', not `1'.  If indexes are specified, they must not
cause conflicts.

   `#define'-d names may also be used for index values.  This is
equivalent to the above:

     #define FIRST 0
     #define LAST  9
     mumble[LAST]  = stumble;
     mumble[FIRST] = grumble;

   All values in a range do *not* have to be filled in.  If you leave
gaps, then you will have a sparse array.  This is fine (*note FOR::).
You have your choice of iterating over all the defined values, or
iterating over a range of slots.  This:

     [+ FOR mumble +][+ ENDFOR +]

iterates over all and only the defined entries, whereas this:

     [+ FOR mumble (for-by 1) +][+ ENDFOR +]

will iterate over all 10 "slots".  Your template will likely have to
contain something like this:

     [+ IF (exist? (sprintf "mumble[%d]" (for-index))) +]

or else "mumble" will have to be a compound value that, say, always
contains a "grumble" value:

     [+ IF (exist? "grumble") +]

2.4 Dynamic Text
================

There are several methods for including dynamic content inside a
definitions file.  Three of them are mentioned above (*note
shell-generated:: and *note scheme-generated::) in the discussion of
string formation rules.  Another method uses the `#shell' processing
directive.  It will be discussed in the next section (*note
Directives::).  Guile/Scheme may also be used to yield to create
definitions.

   When the Scheme expression is preceded by a backslash and single
quote, then the expression is expected to be an alist of names and
values that will be used to create AutoGen definitions.

This method can be be used as follows:

     \'( (name  (value-expression))
         (name2 (another-expr))  )

This is entirely equivalent to:

     name  = (value-expression);
     name2 = (another-expr);

Under the covers, the expression gets handed off to a Guile function
named `alist->autogen-def' in an expression that looks like this:

     (alist->autogen-def
         ( (name (value-expression))  (name2 (another-expr)) ) )

2.5 Controlling What Gets Processed
===================================

Definition processing directives can *only* be processed if the '#'
character is the first character on a line.  Also, if you want a '#' as
the first character of a line in one of your string assignments, you
should either escape it by preceding it with a backslash `\', or by
embedding it in the string as in `"\n#"'.

   All of the normal C preprocessing directives are recognized, though
several are ignored.  There is also an additional `#shell' -
`#endshell' pair.  Another minor difference is that AutoGen directives
must have the hash character (`#') in column 1.

   The final tweak is that `#!' is treated as a comment line.  Using
this feature, you can use:  `#! /usr/local/bin/autogen' as the first
line of a definitions file, set the mode to executable and "run" the
definitions file as if it were a direct invocation of AutoGen.  This
was done for its hack value.

   The ignored directives are: `#ident', `#let', `#pragma', and `#if'.
Note that when ignoring the `#if' directive, all intervening text
through its matching `#endif' is also ignored, including the `#else'
clause.

   The AutoGen directives that affect the processing of definitions are:

`#assert `shell-script` | (scheme-expr) | <anything else>'
     If the `shell-script' or `scheme-expr' do not yield `true' valued
     results, autogen will be aborted.  If `<anything else>' or nothing
     at all is provided, then this directive is ignored.

     When writing the shell script, remember this is on a preprocessing
     line.  Multiple lines must be backslash continued and the result
     is a single long line.  Separate multiple commands with
     semi-colons.

     The result is `false' (and fails) if the result is empty, the
     number zero, or a string that starts with the letters 'n' or 'f'
     ("no" or "false").

`#define name [ <text> ]'
     Will add the name to the define list as if it were a DEFINE program
     argument.  Its value will be the first non-whitespace token
     following the name.  Quotes are *not* processed.

     After the definitions file has been processed, any remaining
     entries in the define list will be added to the environment.

`#elif'
     This must follow an `#if' otherwise it will generate an error.  It
     will be ignored.

`#else'
     This must follow an `#if', `#ifdef' or `#ifndef'.  If it follows
     the `#if', then it will be ignored.  Otherwise, it will change the
     processing state to the reverse of what it was.

`#endif'
     This must follow an `#if', `#ifdef' or `#ifndef'.  In all cases,
     this will resume normal processing of text.

`#endmac'
     This terminates a "macdef", but must not ever be encountered
     directly.

`#endshell'
     Ends the text processed by a command shell into autogen
     definitions.

`#error [ <descriptive text> ]'
     This directive will cause AutoGen to stop processing and exit with
     a status of EXIT_FAILURE.

`#if [ <ignored conditional expression> ]'
     `#if' expressions are not analyzed.  *Everything* from here to the
     matching `#endif' is skipped.

`#ifdef name-to-test'
     The definitions that follow, up to the matching `#endif' will be
     processed only if there is a corresponding `-Dname' command line
     option or if a `#define' of that name has been previously
     encountered.

`#ifndef name-to-test'
     The definitions that follow, up to the matching `#endif' will be
     processed only if there is *not* a corresponding `-Dname' command
     line option or there was a canceling `-Uname' option.

`#include unadorned-file-name'
     This directive will insert definitions from another file into the
     current collection.  If the file name is adorned with double
     quotes or angle brackets (as in a C program), then the include is
     ignored.

`#line'
     Alters the current line number and/or file name.  You may wish to
     use this directive if you extract definition source from other
     files.  `getdefs' uses this mechanism so AutoGen will report the
     correct file and approximate line number of any errors found in
     extracted definitions.

`#macdef'
     This is a new AT&T research preprocessing directive.  Basically,
     it is a multi-line #define that may include other preprocessing
     directives.

`#option opt-name [ <text> ]'
     This directive will pass the option name and associated text to the
     AutoOpts optionLoadLine routine (*note libopts-optionLoadLine::).
     The option text may span multiple lines by continuing them with a
     backslash.  The backslash/newline pair will be replaced with two
     space characters.  This directive may be used to set a search path
     for locating template files For example, this:

          #option templ-dirs $ENVVAR/dirname
     will direct autogen to use the `ENVVAR' environment variable to
     find a directory named `dirname' that (may) contain templates.
     Since these directories are searched in most recently supplied
     first order, search directories supplied in this way will be
     searched before any supplied on the command line.

`#shell'
     Invokes `$SHELL' or `/bin/sh' on a script that should generate
     AutoGen definitions.  It does this using the same server process
     that handles the back-quoted ``' text.  *CAUTION*  let not your
     `$SHELL' be `csh'.

`#undef name-to-undefine'
     Will remove any entries from the define list that match the undef
     name pattern.

2.6 Pre-defined Names
=====================

When AutoGen starts, it tries to determine several names from the
operating environment and put them into environment variables for use in
both `#ifdef' tests in the definitions files and in shell scripts with
environment variable tests.  `__autogen__' is always defined.  For
other names, AutoGen will first try to use the POSIX version of the
`sysinfo(2)' system call.  Failing that, it will try for the POSIX
`uname(2)' call.  If neither is available, then only "`__autogen__'"
will be inserted into the environment.  In all cases, the associated
names are converted to lower case, surrounded by doubled underscores
and non-symbol characters are replaced with underscores.

   With Solaris on a sparc platform, `sysinfo(2)' is available.  The
following strings are used:

   * `SI_SYSNAME' (e.g., "__sunos__")

   * `SI_HOSTNAME' (e.g., "__ellen__")

   * `SI_ARCHITECTURE' (e.g., "__sparc__")

   * `SI_HW_PROVIDER' (e.g., "__sun_microsystems__")

   * `SI_PLATFORM' (e.g., "__sun_ultra_5_10__")

   * `SI_MACHINE' (e.g., "__sun4u__")

   For Linux and other operating systems that only support the
`uname(2)' call, AutoGen will use these values:

   * `sysname' (e.g., "__linux__")

   * `machine' (e.g., "__i586__")

   * `nodename' (e.g., "__bach__")

   By testing these pre-defines in my definitions, you can select
pieces of the definitions without resorting to writing shell scripts
that parse the output of `uname(1)'.  You can also segregate real C
code from autogen definitions by testing for "`__autogen__'".

     #ifdef __bach__
       location = home;
     #else
       location = work;
     #endif

2.7 Commenting Your Definitions
===============================

The definitions file may contain C and C++ style comments.

     /*
      *  This is a comment.  It continues for several lines and closes
      *  when the characters '*' and '/' appear together.
      */
     // this comment is a single line comment

             sub_name  = first;
             sub_field = "sub value.";
         };

         a_subblock = {
             sub_name  = second;

2.9 Finite State Machine Grammar
================================

The preprocessing directives and comments are not part of the grammar.
They are handled by the scanner/lexer.  The following was extracted
directly from the generated defParse-fsm.c source file.  The "EVT:" is
the token seen, the "STATE:" is the current state and the entries in
this table describe the next state and the action to take.  Invalid
transitions were removed from the table.

     dp_trans_table[ DP_STATE_CT ][ DP_EVENT_CT ] = {

       /* STATE 0:  DP_ST_INIT */

2.10 Alternate Definition Forms
===============================

There are several methods for supplying data values for templates.

`no definitions'
     It is entirely possible to write a template that does not depend
     upon external definitions.  Such a template would likely have an
     unvarying output, but be convenient nonetheless because of an
     external library of either AutoGen or Scheme functions, or both.
     This can be accommodated by providing the `--override-tpl' and
     `--no-definitions' options on the command line.  *Note autogen
     Invocation::.

`CGI'
     AutoGen behaves as a CGI server if the definitions input is from
     stdin and the environment variable `REQUEST_METHOD' is defined and
     set to either "GET" or "POST", *Note AutoGen CGI::.  Obviously,
     all the values are constrained to strings because there is no way
     to represent nested values.

`XML'
     AutoGen comes with a program named, `xml2ag'.  Its output can
     either be redirected to a file for later use, or the program can
     be used as an AutoGen wrapper.  *Note xml2ag Invocation::.

     The introductory template example (*note Example Usage::) can be
     rewritten in XML as follows:

          <EXAMPLE  template="list.tpl">
          <LIST list_element="alpha"
                list_info="some alpha stuff"/>
          <LIST list_info="more beta stuff"
                list_element="beta"/>
          <LIST list_element="omega"
                list_info="final omega stuff"/>
          </EXAMPLE>

     A more XML-normal form might look like this:
          <EXAMPLE  template="list.tpl">
          <LIST list_element="alpha">some alpha stuff</LIST>
          <LIST list_element="beta" >more beta stuff</LIST>
          <LIST list_element="omega">final omega stuff</LIST>
          </EXAMPLE>
     but you would have to change the template `list_info' references
     into `text' references.

`standard AutoGen definitions'
     Of course.  :-)

3 Template File
***************

The AutoGen template file defines the content of the output text.  It
is composed of two parts.  The first part consists of a pseudo macro
invocation and commentary.  It is followed by the template proper.

   This pseudo macro is special.  It is used to identify the file as a
AutoGen template file, fixing the starting and ending marks for the
macro invocations in the rest of the file, specifying the list of
suffixes to be generated by the template and, optionally, the shell to
use for processing shell commands embedded in the template.

   AutoGen-ing a file consists of copying text from the template to the
output file until a start macro marker is found.  The text from the
start marker to the end marker constitutes the macro text.  AutoGen
macros may cause sections of the template to be skipped or processed
several times.  The process continues until the end of the template is
reached.  The process is repeated once for each suffix specified in the
pseudo macro.

   This chapter describes the format of the AutoGen template macros and
the usage of the AutoGen native macros.  Users may augment these by
defining their own macros, *Note DEFINE::.

File: autogen.info,  Node: pseudo macro,  Next: naming values,  Up: Template File

3.1 Format of the Pseudo Macro
==============================

The pseudo macro is used to tell AutoGen how to process a template.  It
tells autogen:

  1. The start macro marker.  It consists of punctuation characters
     used to demarcate the start of a macro.  It may be up to seven
     characters long and must be the first non-whitespace characters in
     the file.

     It is generally a good idea to use some sort of opening bracket in
     the starting macro and closing bracket in the ending macro  (e.g.
     `{', `(', `[', or even `<' in the starting macro).  It helps both
     visually and with editors capable of finding a balancing
     parenthesis.

  2. That start marker must be immediately followed by the identifier
     strings "AutoGen5" and then "template", though capitalization is
     not important.

The next several components may be intermingled:

  3. Zero, one or more suffix specifications tell AutoGen how many
     times to process the template file.  No suffix specifications mean
     that it is to be processed once and that the generated text is to
     be written to `stdout'.  The current suffix for each pass can be
     determined with the `(suffix)' scheme function (*note SCM
     suffix::).

     The suffix specification consists of a sequence of POSIX compliant
     file name characters and, optionally, an equal sign and a file
     name formatting specification.  That specification may be either
     an ordinary sequence of file name characters with zero, one or two
     "%s" formatting sequences in it, or else it may be a Scheme
     expression that, when evaluated, produces such a string.  The
     Scheme result may not be empty.  The two string arguments allowed
     for that string are the base name of the definition file, and the
     current suffix (that being the text to the left of the equal
     sign).  (Note: "POSIX compliant file name characters" consist of
     alphanumerics plus the period (`.'), hyphen (`-') and underscore
     (`_') characters.)

     If the suffix begins with one of these three latter characters and
     a formatting string is not specified, then that character is
     presumed to be the suffix separator.  Otherwise, without a
     specified format string, a single period will separate the suffix
     from the base name in constructing the output file name.

  4. Shell specification: to specify that the template was written
     expecting a particular shell to run the shell commands.  By
     default, the shell used is the autoconf-ed `CONFIG_SHELL'.  This
     will usually be `/bin/sh'.  The shell is specified by a hash mark
     (`#') followed by an exclamation mark (`!') followed by a
     full-path file name (e.g. `/usr/xpg4/bin/sh' on Solaris):
          [= Autogen5 Template c
          #!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh
          =]

  5. Comments: blank lines, lines starting with a hash mark (`#') and
     not specifying a shell, and edit mode markers (text between pairs
     of `-*-' strings) are all treated as comments.

  6. Some scheme expressions may be inserted in order to make
     configuration changes before template processing begins.  "before
     template processing begins" means that there is no current output
     file, no current suffix and, basically, none of the AutoGen
     specific functions (*note AutoGen Functions::) may be invoked.

     The scheme expression can also be used, for example, to save a
     pre-existing output file for later text extraction (*note SCM
     extract::).

          (shellf "mv -f %1$s.c %1$s.sav" (base-name))

After these must come the end macro marker:

  6. The punctuation characters used to demarcate the end of a macro.
     Like the start marker, it must consist of seven or fewer
     punctuation characters.

   The ending macro marker has a few constraints on its content.  Some
of them are just advisory, though.  There is no special check for
advisory restrictions.

   * It must not begin with a POSIX file name character (hyphen `-',
     underscore `_' or period `.'), the backslash (`\') or open
     parenthesis (`(').  These are used to identify a suffix
     specification, indicate Scheme code and trim white space.

   * If it begins with an equal sign, then it must be separated from
     any suffix specification by white space.

   * The closing marker may not begin with an open parenthesis, as that
     is used to enclose a scheme expression.

   * It cannot begin with a backslash, as that is used to indicate white
     space trimming after the end macro mark.  If, in the body of the
     template, you put the backslash character (`\') before the end
     macro mark, then any white space characters after the mark and
     through the newline character are trimmed.

   * It is also helpful to avoid using the comment marker (`#').  It
     might be seen as a comment within the pseudo macro.

   * You should avoid using any of the quote characters  double, single
     or back-quote.  It won't confuse AutoGen, but it might well
     confuse you and/or your editor.

   As an example, assume we want to use `[+' and `+]' as the start and
end macro markers, and we wish to produce a `.c' and a `.h' file, then
the pseudo macro might look something like this:

     [+ AutoGen5 template -*- Mode: emacs-mode-of-choice -*-
     h=chk-%s.h
     c
     # make sure we don't use csh:
     (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/sh")  +]

   The template proper starts after the pseudo-macro.  The starting
character is either the first non-whitespace character or the first
character after the newline that follows the end macro marker.

3.2 Naming a value
==================

When an AutoGen value is specified in a template, it is specified by
name.  The name may be a simple name, or a compound name of several
components.  Since each named value in AutoGen is implicitly an array
of one or more values, each component may have an index associated with
it.

It looks like this:

     comp-name-1 . comp-name-2 [ 2 ]

   Note that if there are multiple components to a name, each component
name is separated by a dot (`.').  Indexes follow a component name,
enclosed in square brackets (`[' and `]').  The index may be either an
integer or an integer-valued define name.  The first component of the
name is searched for in the current definition level.  If not found,
higher levels will be searched until either a value is found, or there
are no more definition levels.  Subsequent components of the name must
be found within the context of the newly-current definition level.
Also, if the named value is prefixed by a dot (`.'), then the value
search is started in the current context only.  Backtracking into other
definition levels is prevented.

   If someone rewrites this, I'll incorporate it.  :-)


File: autogen.info,  Node: expression syntax,  Next: AutoGen Functions,  Prev: naming values,  Up: Template File

3.3 Macro Expression Syntax
===========================

AutoGen has two types of expressions:  full expressions and basic ones.
A full AutoGen expression can appear by itself, or as the argument to
certain AutoGen built-in macros:  CASE, IF, ELIF, INCLUDE, INVOKE
(explicit invocation, *note INVOKE::), and WHILE.  If it appears by
itself, the result is inserted into the output.  If it is an argument
to one of these macros, the macro code will act on it sensibly.

   You are constrained to basic expressions only when passing arguments
to user defined macros, *Note DEFINE::.

   The syntax of a full AutoGen expression is:

     [[ <apply-code> ] <value-name> ] [ <basic-expr-1> [ <basic-expr-2> ]]

   How the expression is evaluated depends upon the presence or absence
of the apply code and value name.  The "value name" is the name of an
AutoGen defined value, or not.  If it does not name such a value, the
expression result is generally the empty string.  All expressions must
contain either a `value-name' or a `basic-expr'.

* Menu:

* apply code::           Apply Code
* basic expression::     Basic Expression


File: autogen.info,  Node: apply code,  Next: basic expression,  Up: expression syntax

3.3.1 Apply Code
----------------

The "apply code" selected determines the method of evaluating the
expression.  There are five apply codes, including the non-use of an
apply code.

`no apply code'
     This is the most common expression type.  Expressions of this sort
     come in three flavors:

    `<value-name>'
          The result is the value of `value-name', if defined.
          Otherwise it is the empty string.

    `<basic-expr>'
          The result of the basic expression is the result of the full
          expression, *Note basic expression::.

    `<value-name> <basic-expr>'
          If there is a defined value for `value-name', then the
          `basic-expr' is evaluated.  Otherwise, the result is the
          empty string.

`% <value-name> <basic-expr>'
     If `value-name' is defined, use `basic-expr' as a format string
     for sprintf.  Then, if the `basic-expr' is either a back-quoted
     string or a parenthesized expression, then hand the result to the
     appropriate interpreter for further evaluation.  Otherwise, for
     single and double quote strings, the result is the result of the
     sprintf operation.  Naturally, if `value-name' is not defined, the
     result is the empty string.

     For example, assume that `fumble' had the string value, `stumble':
          [+ % fumble `printf '%%x\\n' $%s` +]
     This would cause the shell to evaluate "`printf '%x\n' $stumble'".
     Assuming that the shell variable `stumble' had a numeric value,
     the expression result would be that number, in hex.  Note the need
     for doubled percent characters and backslashes.

`? <value-name> <basic-expr-1> <basic-expr-2>'
     Two `basic-expr'-s are required.  If the `value-name' is defined,
     then the first `basic-expr-1' is evaluated, otherwise
     `basic-expr-2' is.

`- <value-name> <basic-expr>'
     Evaluate `basic-expr' only if `value-name' is not defined.

`?% <value-name> <basic-expr-1> <basic-expr-2>'
     This combines the functions of `?' and `%'.  If `value-name' is
     defined, it behaves exactly like `%', above, using `basic-expr-1'.
     If not defined, then `basic-expr-2' is evaluated.

     For example, assume again that `fumble' had the string value,
     `stumble':
          [+ ?% fumble `cat $%s` `pwd` +]
     This would cause the shell to evaluate "`cat $stumble'".  If
     `fumble' were not defined, then the result would be the name of
     our current directory.


File: autogen.info,  Node: basic expression,  Prev: apply code,  Up: expression syntax

3.3.2 Basic Expression
----------------------

A basic expression can have one of the following forms:

`'STRING''
     A single quoted string.  Backslashes can be used to protect single
     quotes (`''), hash characters (`#'), or backslashes (`\') in the
     string.  All other characters of STRING are output as-is when the
     single quoted string is evaluated.  Backslashes are processed
     before the hash character for consistency with the definition
     syntax.  It is needed there to avoid preprocessing conflicts.

`"STRING"'
     A double quoted string.  This is a cooked text string as in C,
     except that they are not concatenated with adjacent strings.
     Evaluating "`STRING'" will output STRING with all backslash
     sequences interpreted.

``STRING`'
     A back quoted string.  When this expression is evaluated, STRING
     is first interpreted as a cooked string (as in `"STRING"') and
     evaluated as a shell expression by the AutoGen server shell.  This
     expression is replaced by the `stdout' output of the shell.

`(STRING)'
     A parenthesized expression.  It will be passed to the Guile
     interpreter for evaluation and replaced by the resulting value.
     If there is a Scheme error in this expression, Guile 1.4 and Guile
     1.6 will report the template line number where the error occurs.
     Guile 1.7 has lost this capability.

     Guile has the capability of creating and manipulating variables
     that can be referenced later on in the template processing.  If
     you define such a variable, it is invisible to AutoGen.  To
     reference its value, you must use a Guile expression.  For example,
          [+ (define my-var "some-string-value") +]
     can have that string inserted later, but only as in:
          [+ (. my-var) +]

     Additionally, other than in the `%' and `?%' expressions, the
     Guile expressions may be introduced with the Guile comment
     character (`;') and you may put a series of Guile expressions
     within a single macro.  They will be implicitly evaluated as if
     they were arguments to the `(begin ...)' expression.  The result
     will be the result of the last Guile expression evaluated.

3.4 AutoGen Scheme Functions
============================

AutoGen uses Guile to interpret Scheme expressions within AutoGen
macros.  All of the normal Guile functions are available, plus several
extensions (*note Common Functions::) have been added to augment the
repertoire of string manipulation functions and manage the state of
AutoGen processing.

   This section describes those functions that are specific to AutoGen.
Please take note that these AutoGen specific functions are not loaded
and thus not made available until after the command line options have
been processed and the AutoGen definitions have been loaded.  They may,
of course, be used in Scheme functions that get defined at those times,
but they cannot be invoked.

File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM ag-fprintf,  Next: SCM ag-function?,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.1 `ag-fprintf' - format to autogen stream
---------------------------------------------

Usage:  (ag-fprintf ag-diversion format [ format-arg ... ])
Format a string using arguments from the alist.  Write to a specified
AutoGen diversion.  That may be either a specified suspended output
stream (*note SCM out-suspend::) or an index into the output stack
(*note SCM out-push-new::).  `(ag-fprintf 0 ...)' is equivalent to
`(emit (sprintf ...))', and `(ag-fprintf 1 ...)' sends output to the
most recently suspended output stream.

   Arguments:
ag-diversion - AutoGen diversion name or number
format - formatting string
format-arg - Optional - list of arguments to formatting string


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM ag-function?,  Next: SCM base-name,  Prev: SCM ag-fprintf,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.2 `ag-function?' - test for function
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (ag-function? ag-name)
return SCM_BOOL_T if a specified name is a user-defined AutoGen macro,
otherwise return SCM_BOOL_F.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen macro


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM base-name,  Next: SCM chdir,  Prev: SCM ag-function?,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.3 `base-name' - base output name
------------------------------------

Usage:  (base-name)
Returns a string containing the base name of the output file(s).
Generally, this is also the base name of the definitions file.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM chdir,  Next: SCM count,  Prev: SCM base-name,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.4 `chdir' - Change current directory
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (chdir dir)
Sets the current directory for AutoGen.  Shell commands will run from
this directory as well.  This is a wrapper around the Guile native
function.  It returns its directory name argument and fails the program
on failure.

   Arguments:
dir - new directory name


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM count,  Next: SCM def-file,  Prev: SCM chdir,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.5 `count' - definition count
--------------------------------

Usage:  (count ag-name)
Count the number of entries for a definition.  The input argument must
be a string containing the name of the AutoGen values to be counted.
If there is no value associated with the name, the result is an SCM
immediate integer value of zero.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM def-file,  Next: SCM def-file-line,  Prev: SCM count,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.6 `def-file' - definitions file name
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (def-file)
Get the name of the definitions file.  Returns the name of the source
file containing the AutoGen definitions.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM def-file-line,  Next: SCM dne,  Prev: SCM def-file,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.7 `def-file-line' - get a definition file+line number
---------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (def-file-line ag-name [ msg-fmt ])
Returns the file and line number of a AutoGen defined value, using
either the default format, "from %s line %d", or else the format you
supply.  For example, if you want to insert a "C" language file-line
directive, you would supply the format "# %2$d \"%1$s\"", but that is
also already supplied with the scheme variable *Note SCM
c-file-line-fmt::.  You may use it thus:

     (def-file-line "ag-def-name" c-file-line-fmt)

   It is also safe to use the formatting string, "%2$d".  AutoGen uses
an argument vector version of printf: *Note snprintfv::.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value
msg-fmt - Optional - formatting for line message


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM dne,  Next: SCM emit,  Prev: SCM def-file-line,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.8 `dne' - "Do Not Edit" warning
-----------------------------------

Usage:  (dne prefix [ first_prefix ] [ optpfx ])
Generate a "DO NOT EDIT" or "EDIT WITH CARE" warning string.  Which
depends on whether or not the `--writable' command line option was set.

   The first argument may be an option:  -d

   This will suppress the variable text (date and version information).
If specified, then the "prefix" and "first" arguments are shifted to
the next arguments.

   The first argument is a per-line string prefix.  The optional second
argument is a prefix for the first-line and, in read-only mode,
activates the editor hints.
     -*- buffer-read-only: t -*- vi: set ro:
The warning string also includes information about the template used to
construct the file and the definitions used in its instantiation.

   The optional third argument is used when the first argument is
actually an invocation option and the prefix arguments get shifted.
The first argument must be, specifically, "`-d'".  That is used to
signify that the date stamp should not be inserted into the output.

   Arguments:
prefix - string for starting each output line
first_prefix - Optional - for the first output line
optpfx - Optional - shifted prefix

3.4.9 `emit' - emit the text for each argument
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (emit alist ...)
Walk the tree of arguments, displaying the values of displayable SCM
types.  EXCEPTION: if the first argument is a number, then that number
is used to index the output stack.  "0" is the default, the current
output.

   Arguments:
alist - list of arguments to stringify and emit


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM emit-string-table,  Next: SCM error,  Prev: SCM emit,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.10 `emit-string-table' - output a string table
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (emit-string-table st-name)
Emit into the current output stream a `static char const' array named
`st-name' that will have `NUL' bytes between each inserted string.

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM error,  Next: SCM exist?,  Prev: SCM emit-string-table,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.11 `error' - display message and exit
-----------------------------------------

Usage:  (error message)
The argument is a string that printed out as part of an error message.
The message is formed from the formatting string:

     DEFINITIONS ERROR in %s line %d for %s:  %s\n

   The first three arguments to this format are provided by the routine
and are:  The name of the template file, the line within the template
where the error was found, and the current output file name.

   After displaying the message, the current output file is removed and
autogen exits with the EXIT_FAILURE error code.  IF, however, the
argument begins with the number 0 (zero), or the string is the empty
string, then processing continues with the next suffix.

   Arguments:
message - message to display before exiting


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM exist?,  Next: SCM find-file,  Prev: SCM error,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.12 `exist?' - test for value name
-------------------------------------

Usage:  (exist? ag-name)
return SCM_BOOL_T iff a specified name has an AutoGen value.  The name
may include indexes and/or member names.  All but the last member name
must be an aggregate definition.  For example:
     (exist? "foo[3].bar.baz")
   will yield true if all of the following is true:
There is a member value of either group or string type named `baz' for
some group value `bar' that is a member of the `foo' group with index
`3'.  There may be multiple entries of `bar' within `foo', only one
needs to contain a value for `baz'.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.13 `find-file' - locate a file in the search path
-----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (find-file file-name [ suffix ])
AutoGen has a search path that it uses to locate template and definition
files.  This function will search the same list for `file-name', both
with and without the `.suffix', if provided.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of file with text
suffix - Optional - file suffix to try, too


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM first-for?,  Next: SCM for-by,  Prev: SCM find-file,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.14 `first-for?' - detect first iteration
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (first-for? [ for_var ])
Returns SCM_BOOL_T if the named FOR loop (or, if not named, the current

File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM for-index,  Next: SCM for-sep,  Prev: SCM for-from,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.17 `for-index' - get current loop index
-------------------------------------------

Usage:  (for-index [ for_var ])
Returns the current index for the named FOR loop.  If not named, then
the index for the innermost loop.  Outside of any FOR loop, it returns
SCM_UNDEFINED.  *Note FOR::.

   Arguments:
for_var - Optional - which for loop


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM for-sep,  Next: SCM for-to,  Prev: SCM for-index,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.18 `for-sep' - set loop separation string
---------------------------------------------

Usage:  (for-sep separator)
This function records the separation string that is to be inserted
between each iteration of an AutoGen FOR function.  This is often
nothing more than a comma.  Outside of the FOR macro itself, this
function will emit an error.

alt-val - Optional - value if not present


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM get-c-name,  Next: SCM get-down-name,  Prev: SCM get,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.21 `get-c-name' - get named value, mapped to C name syntax
--------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (get-c-name ag-name)
Get the first string value associated with the name.  It will either

File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM high-lim,  Next: SCM last-for?,  Prev: SCM get-up-name,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.24 `high-lim' - get highest value index
-------------------------------------------

Usage:  (high-lim ag-name)
Returns the highest index associated with an array of definitions.
This is generally, but not necessarily, one less than the `count'
value.  (The indexes may be specified, rendering a non-zero based or
sparse array of values.)

   This is very useful for specifying the size of a zero-based array of
values where not all values are present.  For example:

     tMyStruct myVals[ [+ (+ 1 (high-lim "my-val-list")) +] ];

   Arguments:

------------------------------------------

Usage:  (last-for? [ for_var ])
Returns SCM_BOOL_T if the named FOR loop (or, if not named, the current

File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM len,  Next: SCM low-lim,  Prev: SCM last-for?,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.26 `len' - get count of values
----------------------------------

Usage:  (len ag-name)
If the named object is a group definition, then "len" is the same as
"count".  Otherwise, if it is one or more text definitions, then it is
the sum of their string lengths.  If it is a single text definition,
then it is equivalent to `(string-length (get "ag-name"))'.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM low-lim,  Next: SCM make-header-guard,  Prev: SCM len,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.27 `low-lim' - get lowest value index
-----------------------------------------

Usage:  (low-lim ag-name)
Returns the lowest index associated with an array of definitions.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM make-header-guard,  Next: SCM make-tmp-dir,  Prev: SCM low-lim,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.28 `make-header-guard' - make self-inclusion guard
------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (make-header-guard name)
This function will create a `#ifndef'/`#define' sequence for protecting
a header from multiple evaluation.  It will also set the Scheme
variable `header-file' to the name of the file being protected and it
will set `header-guard' to the name of the `#define' being used to
protect it.  It is expected that this will be used as follows:
     [+ (make-header-guard "group_name") +]
     ...
     #endif /* [+ (. header-guard) +] */

     #include "[+ (. header-file)  +]"
   The `#define' name is composed as follows:

  1. The first element is the string argument and a separating
     underscore.

  2. That is followed by the name of the header file with illegal
     characters mapped to underscores.

  3. The end of the name is always, "`_GUARD'".

  4. Finally, the entire string is mapped to upper case.

   The final `#define' name is stored in an SCM symbol named
`header-guard'.  Consequently, the concluding `#endif' for the file
should read something like:

     #endif /* [+ (. header-guard) +] */

   The name of the header file (the current output file) is also stored
in an SCM symbol, `header-file'.  Therefore, if you are also generating
a C file that uses the previously generated header file, you can put
this into that generated file:

     #include "[+ (. header-file) +]"

   Obviously, if you are going to produce more than one header file from
a particular template, you will need to be careful how these SCM symbols
get handled.

   Arguments:
name - header group name

File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM match-value?,  Next: SCM out-delete,  Prev: SCM make-tmp-dir,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.30 `match-value?' - test for matching value
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (match-value? op ag-name test-str)
This function answers the question, "Is there an AutoGen value named
`ag-name' with a value that matches the pattern `test-str' using the
match function `op'?"  Return SCM_BOOL_T iff at least one occurrence of
the specified name has such a value.  The operator can be any function
that takes two string arguments and yields a boolean.  It is expected
that you will use one of the string matching functions provided by
AutoGen.
The value name must follow the same rules as the `ag-name' argument for
`exist?' (*note SCM exist?::).

   Arguments:
op - boolean result operator
ag-name - name of AutoGen value
test-str - string to test against


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-delete,  Next: SCM out-depth,  Prev: SCM match-value?,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.31 `out-delete' - delete current output file
------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-delete)
Remove the current output file.  Cease processing the template for the
current suffix.  It is an error if there are `push'-ed output files.
Use the `(error "0")' scheme function instead.  *Note output controls::.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-depth,  Next: SCM out-emit-suspended,  Prev: SCM out-delete,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.33 `out-emit-suspended' - emit the text of suspended output
---------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-emit-suspended susp_nm)
This function is equivalent to `(begin (out-resume <name>) (out-pop
#t))'

File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-line,  Next: SCM out-move,  Prev: SCM out-emit-suspended,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.34 `out-line' - output file line number
-------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-line)
Returns the current line number of the output file.  It rewinds and
reads the file to count newlines.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-move,  Next: SCM out-name,  Prev: SCM out-line,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.35 `out-move' - change name of output file
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-move new-name)
Rename current output file.  *Note output controls::.  Please note:
changing the name will not save a temporary file from being deleted.
It may, however, be used on the root output file.

   Arguments:
new-name - new name for the current output file


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-name,  Next: SCM out-pop,  Prev: SCM out-move,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.36 `out-name' - current output file name
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-name)
Returns the name of the current output file.  If the current file is a
temporary, unnamed file, then it will scan up the chain until a real
output file name is found.  *Note output controls::.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-pop,  Next: SCM out-push-add,  Prev: SCM out-name,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.37 `out-pop' - close current output file
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-pop [ disp ])
If there has been a `push' on the output, then close that file and go
back to the previously open file.  It is an error if there has not been
a `push'.  *Note output controls::.

   If there is no argument, no further action is taken.  Otherwise, the
argument should be `#t' and the contents of the file are returned by
the function.

   Arguments:
disp - Optional - return contents of the file


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-push-add,  Next: SCM out-push-new,  Prev: SCM out-pop,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.38 `out-push-add' - append output to file
---------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-push-add file-name)
Identical to `push-new', except the contents are *not* purged, but
appended to.  *Note output controls::.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of the file to append text to


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-push-new,  Next: SCM out-resume,  Prev: SCM out-push-add,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.39 `out-push-new' - purge and create output file
----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-push-new [ file-name ])
Leave the current output file open, but purge and create a new file
that will remain open until a `pop' `delete' or `switch' closes it.
The file name is optional and, if omitted, the output will be sent to a
temporary file that will be deleted when it is closed.  *Note output
controls::.

   Arguments:
file-name - Optional - name of the file to create


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-resume,  Next: SCM out-suspend,  Prev: SCM out-push-new,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.40 `out-resume' - resume suspended output file
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-resume susp_nm)
If there has been a suspended output, then make that output descriptor
current again.  That output must have been suspended with the same tag
name given to this routine as its argument.

   Arguments:
susp_nm - A name tag for reactivating


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-suspend,  Next: SCM out-switch,  Prev: SCM out-resume,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.41 `out-suspend' - suspend current output file
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-suspend suspName)
If there has been a `push' on the output, then set aside the output
descriptor for later reactiviation with `(out-resume "xxx")'.  The tag
name need not reflect the name of the output file.  In fact, the output
file may be an anonymous temporary file.  You may also change the tag
every time you suspend output to a file, because the tag names are
forgotten as soon as the file has been "resumed".

   Arguments:
suspName - A name tag for reactivating


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM out-switch,  Next: SCM output-file-next-line,  Prev: SCM out-suspend,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.42 `out-switch' - close and create new output
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-switch file-name)
Switch output files - close current file and make the current file
pointer refer to the new file.  This is equivalent to `out-pop'
followed by `out-push-new', except that you may not pop the base level
output file, but you may `switch' it.  *Note output controls::.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of the file to create


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM output-file-next-line,  Next: SCM set-option,  Prev: SCM out-switch,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.43 `output-file-next-line' - print the file name and next line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (output-file-next-line [ line_off ] [ alt_fmt ])
Returns a string with the current output file name and line number.
The default format is: # <line+1> "<output-file-name>" The argument may
be either a number indicating an offset from the current output line
number or an alternate formatting string.  If both are provided, then
the first must be a numeric offset.

   Be careful that you are directing output to the final output file.
Otherwise, you will get the file name and line number of the temporary
file.  That won't be what you want.

   Arguments:
line_off - Optional - offset to line number
alt_fmt - Optional - alternate format string


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM set-option,  Next: SCM set-writable,  Prev: SCM output-file-next-line,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.44 `set-option' - Set a command line option
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (set-option opt)
The text argument must be an option name followed by any needed option
argument.  Returns SCM_UNDEFINED.

   Arguments:
opt - AutoGen option name + its argument


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM set-writable,  Next: SCM stack,  Prev: SCM set-option,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.45 `set-writable' - Make the output file be writable
--------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (set-writable [ set? ])
This function will set the current output file to be writable (or not).
This is only effective if neither the `--writable' nor `--not-writable'
have been specified.  This state is reset when the current suffix's
output is complete.

   Arguments:
set? - Optional - boolean arg, false to make output non-writable


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM stack,  Next: SCM stack-join,  Prev: SCM set-writable,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.46 `stack' - make list of AutoGen values
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (stack ag-name)
Create a scheme list of all the strings that are associated with a
name.  They must all be text values or we choke.

   Arguments:
ag-name - AutoGen value name


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM stack-join,  Next: SCM suffix,  Prev: SCM stack,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.47 `stack-join' - stack values then join them
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (stack-join join ag-name)
This function will collect all the values named `ag-name' (see the
*note stack function: SCM stack.) and join them separated by the `join'
string (see the *note join function: SCM join.).

   Arguments:
join - string between each element
ag-name - name of autogen values to stack


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM suffix,  Next: SCM tpl-file,  Prev: SCM stack-join,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.48 `suffix' - get the current suffix
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (suffix)
Returns the current active suffix (*note pseudo macro::).

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM tpl-file,  Next: SCM tpl-file-line,  Prev: SCM suffix,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.49 `tpl-file' - get the template file name
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (tpl-file [ full_path ])
Returns the name of the current template file.  If `#t' is passed in as
an argument, then the template file is hunted for in the template
search path.  Otherwise, just the unadorned name.

   Arguments:
full_path - Optional - include full path to file


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM tpl-file-line,  Next: SCM tpl-file-next-line,  Prev: SCM tpl-file,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.50 `tpl-file-line' - get the template file+line number
----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (tpl-file-line [ msg-fmt ])
Returns the file and line number of the current template macro using
either the default format, "from %s line %d", or else the format you
supply.  For example, if you want to insert a "C" language file-line
directive, you would supply the format "# %2$d \"%1$s\"", but that is
also already supplied with the scheme variable *Note SCM
c-file-line-fmt::.  You may use it thus:
     (tpl-file-line c-file-line-fmt)

   It is also safe to use the formatting string, "%2$d".  AutoGen uses
an argument vector version of printf: *Note snprintfv::, and it does
not need to know the types of each argument in order to skip forward to
the second argument.

   Arguments:
msg-fmt - Optional - formatting for line message


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM tpl-file-next-line,  Next: SCM autogen-version,  Prev: SCM tpl-file-line,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.51 `tpl-file-next-line' - get the template file plus next line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (tpl-file-next-line [ msg-fmt ])
This is almost the same as *Note SCM tpl-file-line::, except that the
line referenced is the next line, per C compiler conventions, and
consequently defaults to the format:  # <line-no+1> "<file-name>"

   Arguments:
msg-fmt - Optional - formatting for line message


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM autogen-version,  Next: SCM c-file-line-fmt,  Prev: SCM tpl-file-next-line,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.52 `autogen-version' - autogen version number
-------------------------------------------------

This is a symbol defining the current AutoGen version number string.
It was first defined in AutoGen-5.2.14.  It is currently "5.15".


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM c-file-line-fmt,  Prev: SCM autogen-version,  Up: AutoGen Functions

3.4.53 format file info as, "`#line nn "file"'"
-----------------------------------------------

This is a symbol that can easily be used with the functions *Note SCM
tpl-file-line::, and *Note SCM def-file-line::.  These will emit C
program `#line' directives pointing to template and definitions text,
respectively.

3.5 Common Scheme Functions
===========================

This section describes a number of general purpose functions that make
the kind of string processing that AutoGen does a little easier.
Unlike the AutoGen specific functions (*note AutoGen Functions::),
these functions are available for direct use during definition load
time.  The equality test (*note SCM =::) is "overloaded" to do string
equivalence comparisons.  If you are looking for inequality, the
Scheme/Lisp way of spelling that is, "(not (= ...))".

3.5.1 `agpl' - GNU Affero General Public License
------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (agpl prog-name prefix)
Emit a string that contains the GNU Affero General Public License.
This function is now deprecated.  Please *Note SCM
license-description::.

   Arguments:
prog-name - name of the program under the GPL
prefix - String for starting each output line


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM bsd,  Next: SCM c-string,  Prev: SCM agpl,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.2 `bsd' - BSD Public License
--------------------------------

Usage:  (bsd prog_name owner prefix)
Emit a string that contains the Free BSD Public License.  This function
is now deprecated.  Please *Note SCM license-description::.

   Arguments:
prog_name - name of the program under the BSD
owner - Grantor of the BSD License
prefix - String for starting each output line


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM c-string,  Next: SCM error-source-line,  Prev: SCM bsd,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.3 `c-string' - emit string for ANSI C
-----------------------------------------

Usage:  (c-string string)
Reform a string so that, when printed, the C compiler will be able to
compile the data and construct a string that contains exactly what the
current string contains.  Many non-printing characters are replaced with
escape sequences.  Newlines are replaced with a backslash, an `n', a
closing quote, a newline, seven spaces and another re-opening quote.
The compiler will implicitly concatenate them.  The reader will see line
breaks.

   A K&R compiler will choke.  Use `kr-string' for that compiler.

   Arguments:
string - string to reformat


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM error-source-line,  Next: SCM extract,  Prev: SCM c-string,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.4 `error-source-line' - display of file & line
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (error-source-line)
This function is only invoked just before Guile displays an error
message.  It displays the file name and line number that triggered the
evaluation error.  You should not need to invoke this routine directly.
Guile will do it automatically.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM extract,  Next: SCM format-arg-count,  Prev: SCM error-source-line,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.5 `extract' - extract text from another file
------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (extract file-name marker-fmt [ caveat ] [ default ])
This function is used to help construct output files that may contain
text that is carried from one version of the output to the next.

   The first two arguments are required, the second are optional:

   * The `file-name' argument is used to name the file that contains
     the demarcated text.

   * The `marker-fmt' is a formatting string that is used to construct
     the starting and ending demarcation strings.  The sprintf function
     is given the `marker-fmt' with two arguments.  The first is either
     "START" or "END".  The second is either "DO NOT CHANGE THIS
     COMMENT" or the optional `caveat' argument.

   * `caveat' is presumed to be absent if it is the empty string
     (`""').  If absent, "DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT" is used as the
     second string argument to the `marker-fmt'.

   * When a `default' argument is supplied and no pre-existing text is
     found, then this text will be inserted between the START and END
     markers.

The resulting strings are presumed to be unique within the subject
file.  As a simplified example:

     [+ (extract "fname" "// %s - SOMETHING - %s" ""
     "example default") +]
   will result in the following text being inserted into the output:

     // START - SOMETHING - DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT
     example default
     // END   - SOMETHING - DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT

The "`example default'" string can then be carried forward to the next
generation of the output, *provided* the output is not named "`fname'"
and the old output is renamed to "`fname'" before AutoGen-eration
begins.

*NB:*
     You can set aside previously generated source files inside the
     pseudo macro with a Guile/scheme function, extract the text you
     want to keep with this extract function.  Just remember you should
     delete it at the end, too.  Here is an example from my Finite
     State Machine generator:

          [+ AutoGen5 Template  -*- Mode: text -*-
          h=%s-fsm.h   c=%s-fsm.c
          (shellf
          "test -f %1$s-fsm.h && mv -f %1$s-fsm.h .fsm.head
          test -f %1$s-fsm.c && mv -f %1$s-fsm.c .fsm.code" (base-name))
          +]

     This code will move the two previously produced output files to
     files named ".fsm.head" and ".fsm.code".  At the end of the 'c'
     output processing, I delete them.

*also NB:*
     This function presumes that the output file ought to be editable so
     that the code between the `START' and `END' marks can be edited by
     the template user.  Consequently, when the `(extract ...)' function
     is invoked, if the `writable' option has not been specified, then
     it will be set at that point.  If this is not the desired
     behavior, the `--not-writable' command line option will override
     this.  Also, you may use the guile function `(chmod "file"
     mode-value)' to override whatever AutoGen is using for the result
     mode.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of file with text
marker-fmt - format for marker text
caveat - Optional - warn about changing marker
default - Optional - default initial text

3.5.6 `format-arg-count' - count the args to a format
-----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (format-arg-count format)
Sometimes, it is useful to simply be able to figure out how many
arguments are required by a format string.  For example, if you are
extracting a format string for the purpose of generating a macro to
invoke a printf-like function, you can run the formatting string
through this function to determine how many arguments to provide for in
the macro. e.g. for this extraction text:

      /*=fumble bumble
       * fmt: 'stumble %s: %d\n'
      =*/

You may wish to generate a macro:

      #define BUMBLE(a1,a2) printf_like(something,(a1),(a2))

You can do this by knowing that the format needs two arguments.

   Arguments:
format - formatting string


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM fprintf,  Next: SCM gperf,  Prev: SCM format-arg-count,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.7 `fprintf' - format to a file
----------------------------------

Usage:  (fprintf port format [ format-arg ... ])
Format a string using arguments from the alist.  Write to a specified
port.  The result will NOT appear in your output.  Use this to print
information messages to a template user.

   Arguments:
port - Guile-scheme output port
format - formatting string
format-arg - Optional - list of arguments to formatting string


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM gperf,  Next: SCM gperf-code,  Prev: SCM fprintf,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.8 `gperf' - perform a perfect hash function
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (gperf name str)
Perform the perfect hash on the input string.  This is only useful if
you have previously created a gperf program with the `make-gperf'
function *Note SCM make-gperf::.  The `name' you supply here must match
the name used to create the program and the string to hash must be one
of the strings supplied in the `make-gperf' string list.  The result
will be a perfect hash index.

   See the documentation for `gperf(1GNU)' for more details.

   Arguments:
name - name of hash list
str - string to hash


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM gperf-code,  Next: SCM gpl,  Prev: SCM gperf,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.9 `gperf-code' - emit the source of the generated gperf program
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (gperf-code st-name)
Returns the contents of the emitted code, suitable for inclusion in
another program.  The interface contains the following elements:

`struct <st-name>_index'
     containg the fields: `{char const * name, int const id; };'

`<st-name>_hash()'
     This is the hashing function with local only scope (static).

`<st-name>_find()'
     This is the searching and validation function.  The first argument
     is the string to look up, the second is its length.  It returns a
     pointer to the corresponding `<st-name>_index' entry.

   Use this in your template as follows where "<st-name>" was set to be
"`lookup'":

     [+ (make-gperf "lookup" (join "\n" (stack "name_list")))
     (gperf-code "lookup") +]
     void my_fun(char * str) {
     struct lookup_index * li = lookup_find(str, strlen(str));
     if (li != NULL) printf("%s yields %d\n", str, li->idx);

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the gperf hash list

3.5.10 `gpl' - GNU General Public License
-----------------------------------------

3.5.19 `license-full' - Emit the licensing information and description
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (license-full license prog-name prefix [ owner ] [ years ])
Emit all the text that `license-info' and `license-description' would
emit (*note `license-info': SCM license-info, and *note
`license-description': SCM license-description.), with all the same
substitutions.

   All of these depend upon the existence of a license file named after
the `license' argument with a `.lic' suffix.  That file should contain
three blocks of text, each separated by two or more newline characters.

   The first section describes copyright attribution and the name of
the usage licence.  For GNU software, this should be the text that is
to be displayed with the program version.  Four text markers can be
replaced: <PFX>, <program>, <years> and <owner>.

   The second section is a short description of the terms of the
license.  This is typically the kind of text that gets displayed in the
header of source files.  The third section is strictly the name of the
license without any substitution markers.  Only the <PFX>, <owner> and
<program> markers are substituted.

   The third section is strictly the name of the license.  No marker
substitutions are performed.

Usage:  (license-info license prog-name prefix [ owner ] [ years ])
Emit a string that contains the licensing description, with some
substitutions for program name, copyright holder, a list of years when
the source was modified, and a per-line prefix.  This text typically
includes a brief license description and is often printed out when a
program starts running or as part of the `--version' output.  For more
details, *Note the license-full command: SCM license-full.

3.5.22 `make-gperf' - build a perfect hash function program
-----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (make-gperf name strings ...)
Build a program to perform perfect hashes of a known list of input
strings.  This function produces no output, but prepares a program
named, `gperf_<name>' for use by the gperf function *Note SCM gperf::.

   This program will be obliterated as AutoGen exits.  However, you may
incorporate the generated hashing function into your C program with
commands something like the following:

     [+ (shellf "sed '/^int main(/,$d;/^#line/d' ${gpdir}/%s.c"
     name ) +]

   where `name' matches the name provided to this `make-perf' function.
`gpdir' is the variable used to store the name of the temporary
directory used to stash all the files.

   Arguments:
name - name of hash list
strings - list of strings to hash


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM makefile-script,  Next: SCM max,  Prev: SCM make-gperf,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.23 `makefile-script' - create makefile script
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (makefile-script text)
This function will take ordinary shell script text and reformat it so
that it will work properly inside of a makefile shell script.  Not
every shell construct can be supported; the intent is to have most
ordinary scripts work without much, if any, alteration.

   The following transformations are performed on the source text:

  1. Trailing whitespace on each line is stripped.

  2. Except for the last line, the string, " ; \\" is appended to the
     end of every line that does not end with certain special
     characters or keywords.  Note that this will mutilate multi-line
     quoted strings, but `make' renders it impossible to use multi-line
     constructs anyway.

  3. If the line ends with a backslash, it is left alone.

  4. If the line ends with a semi-colon, conjunction operator, pipe
     (vertical bar) or one of the keywords "then", "else" or "in", then
     a space and a backslash is added, but no semi-colon.

  5. The dollar sign character is doubled, unless it immediately
     precedes an opening parenthesis or the single character make
     macros '*', '<', '@', '?' or '%'.  Other single character make
     macros that do not have enclosing parentheses will fail.  For
     shell usage of the "$@", "$?" and "$*" macros, you must enclose
     them with curly braces, e.g., "${?}".  The ksh construct
     `$(<command>)' will not work.  Though some `make's accept `${var}'
     constructs, this function will assume it is for shell
     interpretation and double the dollar character.  You must use
     `$(var)' for all `make' substitutions.

  6. Double dollar signs are replaced by four before the next character
     is examined.

  7. Every line is prefixed with a tab, unless the first line already
     starts with a tab.

  8. The newline character on the last line, if present, is suppressed.

  9. Blank lines are stripped.

 10. Lines starting with "@ifdef", "@ifndef", "@else" and "@endif" are
     presumed to be autoconf "sed" expression tags.  These lines will be
     emitted as-is, with no tab prefix and no line splicing backslash.
     These lines can then be processed at configure time with
     `AC_CONFIG_FILES' sed expressions, similar to:

          sed "/^@ifdef foo/d;/^@endif foo/d;/^@ifndef foo/,/^@endif foo/d"

This function is intended to be used approximately as follows:

     $(TARGET) : $(DEPENDENCIES)
     <+ (out-push-new) +>
     ....mostly arbitrary shell script text....
     <+ (makefile-script (out-pop #t)) +>

   Arguments:
text - the text of the script

3.5.24 `max' - maximum value in list
------------------------------------

Usage:  (max list ...)
Return the maximum value in the list

   Arguments:
list - list of values.  Strings are converted to numbers


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM min,  Next: SCM prefix,  Prev: SCM max,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.25 `min' - minimum value in list

   Arguments:
list - list of values.  Strings are converted to numbers


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM prefix,  Next: SCM printf,  Prev: SCM min,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.26 `prefix' - prefix lines with a string
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (prefix prefix text)
Prefix every line in the second string with the first string.

   For example, if the first string is "# " and the second contains:
     two
     lines
   The result string will contain:
     # two
     # lines

   Arguments:
prefix - string to insert at start of each line

File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM printf,  Next: SCM raw-shell-str,  Prev: SCM prefix,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.27 `printf' - format to stdout
----------------------------------

Usage:  (printf format [ format-arg ... ])
Format a string using arguments from the alist.  Write to the standard
out port.  The result will NOT appear in your output.  Use this to
print information messages to a template user.  Use "(sprintf ...)" to
add text to your document.

   Arguments:
format - formatting string
format-arg - Optional - list of arguments to formatting string


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM raw-shell-str,  Next: SCM shell,  Prev: SCM printf,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.28 `raw-shell-str' - single quote shell string
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (raw-shell-str string)
Convert the text of the string into a singly quoted string that a
normal shell will process into the original string.  (It will not do
macro expansion later, either.)  Contained single quotes become
tripled, with the middle quote escaped with a backslash.  Normal shells
will reconstitute the original string.

   *Notice*:  some shells will not correctly handle unusual
non-printing characters.  This routine works for most reasonably
conventional ASCII strings.

   Arguments:
string - string to transform


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM shell,  Next: SCM shell-str,  Prev: SCM raw-shell-str,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.29 `shell' - invoke a shell script
--------------------------------------

Usage:  (shell command)
Generate a string by writing the value to a server shell and reading the
output back in.  The template programmer is responsible for ensuring
that it completes within 10 seconds.  If it does not, the server will be
killed, the output tossed and a new server started.

   Please note: This is the same server process used by the '#shell'
definitions directive and backquoted ``' definitions.  There may be
left over state from previous shell expressions and the ``' processing
in the declarations.  However, a `cd' to the original directory is
always issued before the new command is issued.

   Also note:  When initializing, autogen will set the environment
variable "AGexe" to the full path of the autogen executable.

   Arguments:
command - shell command - the result value is the stdout output.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM shell-str,  Next: SCM shellf,  Prev: SCM shell,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.30 `shell-str' - double quote shell string
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (shell-str string)
Convert the text of the string into a double quoted string that a normal
shell will process into the original string, almost.  It will add the
escape character `\\' before two special characters to accomplish this:
the backslash `\\' and double quote `"'.

   *Notice*: some shells will not correctly handle unusual non-printing
characters.  This routine works for most reasonably conventional ASCII
strings.

   *WARNING*:
This function omits the extra backslash in front of a backslash,
however, if it is followed by either a backquote or a dollar sign.  It
must do this because otherwise it would be impossible to protect the
dollar sign or backquote from shell evaluation.  Consequently, it is
not possible to render the strings "\\$" or "\\`".  The lesser of two
evils.

   All others characters are copied directly into the output.

   The `sub-shell-str' variation of this routine behaves identically,
except that the extra backslash is omitted in front of `"' instead of
``'.  You have to think about it.  I'm open to suggestions.

   Meanwhile, the best way to document is with a detailed output
example.  If the backslashes make it through the text processing
correctly, below you will see what happens with three example strings.
The first example string contains a list of quoted `foo's, the second is
the same with a single backslash before the quote characters and the
last is with two backslash escapes.  Below each is the result of the
`raw-shell-str', `shell-str' and `sub-shell-str' functions.

     foo[0]           ''foo'' 'foo' "foo" `foo` $foo
     raw-shell-str -> \'\''foo'\'\'' '\''foo'\'' "foo" `foo` $foo'
     shell-str     -> "''foo'' 'foo' \"foo\" `foo` $foo"
     sub-shell-str -> `''foo'' 'foo' "foo" \`foo\` $foo`

     foo[1]           \'bar\' \"bar\" \`bar\` \$bar
     raw-shell-str -> '\'\''bar\'\'' \"bar\" \`bar\` \$bar'
     shell-str     -> "\\'bar\\' \\\"bar\\\" \`bar\` \$bar"
     sub-shell-str -> `\\'bar\\' \"bar\" \\\`bar\\\` \$bar`

     foo[2]           \\'BAZ\\' \\"BAZ\\" \\`BAZ\\` \\$BAZ
     raw-shell-str -> '\\'\''BAZ\\'\'' \\"BAZ\\" \\`BAZ\\` \\$BAZ'
     shell-str     -> "\\\\'BAZ\\\\' \\\\\"BAZ\\\\\" \\\`BAZ\\\` \\\$BAZ"
     sub-shell-str -> `\\\\'BAZ\\\\' \\\"BAZ\\\" \\\\\`BAZ\\\\\` \\\$BAZ`

   There should be four, three, five and three backslashes for the four
examples on the last line, respectively.  The next to last line should
have four, five, three and three backslashes.  If this was not
accurately reproduced, take a look at the agen5/test/shell.test test.
Notice the backslashes in front of the dollar signs.  It goes from zero
to one to three for the "cooked" string examples.

3.5.53 `string-substitute' - multiple global replacements
---------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-substitute source match repl)
`match' and  `repl' may be either a single string or a list of strings.
Either way, they must have the same structure and number of elements.
For example, to replace all amphersands, less than and greater than
characters, do something like this:

     (string-substitute source
     (list "&"     "<"    ">")
     (list "&amp;" "&lt;" "&gt;"))

   Arguments:
source - string to transform
match - substring or substring list to be replaced
repl - replacement strings or substrings

3.5.54 `string-table-add' - Add an entry to a string table
----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-table-add st-name str-val)
Check for a duplicate string and, if none, then insert a new string
into the string table.  In all cases, returns the character index of
the beginning of the string in the table.

   The returned index can be used in expressions like:
     string_array + <returned-value>
   that will yield the address of the first byte of the inserted
string.  See the `strtable.test' AutoGen test for a usage example.

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters
str-val - the (possibly) new value to add


File: autogen.info,  Node: SCM string-table-add-ref,  Next: SCM string-table-new,  Prev: SCM string-table-add,  Up: Common Functions

3.5.55 `string-table-add-ref' - Add an entry to a string table, get reference
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-table-add-ref st-name str-val)
Identical to string-table-add, except the value returned is the string
"st-name" '+' and the index returned by string-table-add.

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters
str-val - the (possibly) new value to add

3.5.56 `string-table-new' - create a string table
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-table-new st-name)
This function will create an array of characters.  The companion
functions, (*Note SCM string-table-add::, *Note SCM
string-table-add-ref::, and *note SCM emit-string-table::) will insert
text and emit the populated table.

   With these functions, it should be much easier to construct
structures containing string offsets instead of string pointers.  That
can be very useful when transmitting, storing or sharing data with
different address spaces.

Here is a brief example copied from the strtable.test test:

     [+ (string-table-new "scribble")
        (out-push-new) ;; redirect output to temporary
        (define ct 1)  +][+

     FOR str IN that was the week that was +][+
       (set! ct (+ ct 1))
     +]
         [+ (string-table-add-ref "scribble" (get "str")) +],[+
     ENDFOR  +]
     [+ (out-suspend "main")
        (emit-string-table "scribble")
        (ag-fprintf 0 "\nchar const *ap[%d] = {" ct)
        (out-resume "main")
        (out-pop #t) ;; now dump out the redirected output +]
         NULL };

Some explanation:

I added the `(out-push-new)' because the string table text is diverted
into an output stream named, "scribble" and I want to have the string
table emitted before the string table references.  The string table
references are also emitted inside the `FOR' loop.  So, when the loop
is done, the current output is suspended under the name, "main" and the
"scribble" table is then emitted into the primary output.
(`emit-string-table' inserts its output directly into the current
output stream.  It does not need to be the last function in an AutoGen
macro block.)  Next I `ag-fprintf' the array-of-pointer declaration
directly into the current output.  Finally I restore the "main" output
stream and `(out-pop #t)'-it into the main output stream.

   Here is the result.  Note that duplicate strings are not repeated in
the string table:

     static char const scribble[18] =
         "that\0" "was\0"  "the\0"  "week\0";

     char const *ap[7] = {
         scribble+0,
         scribble+5,
         scribble+9,
         scribble+13,
         scribble+0,
         scribble+5,
         NULL };

   These functions use the global name space `stt-*' in addition to the
function names.

   If you utilize this in your programming, it is recommended that you
prevent printf format usage warnings with the GCC option
`-Wno-format-contains-nul'

Usage:  (time-string->number time_spec)
Convert the argument string to a time period in seconds.  The string
may use multiple parts consisting of days, hours minutes and seconds.
These are indicated with a suffix of `d', `h', `m' and `s' respectively.

Usage:  (version-compare op v1 v2)
Converts v1 and v2 strings into 64 bit values and returns the result of
running 'op' on those values.  It assumes that the version is a 1 to 4
part dot-separated series of numbers.  Suffixes like, "5pre4" or
"5-pre4" will be interpreted as two numbers.  The first number ("5" in
this case) will be decremented and the number after the "pre" will be
added to 0xC000.  (Unless your platform is unable to support 64 bit
integer arithmetic.  Then it will be added to 0xC0.)  Consequently,
these yield true:
     (version-compare > "5.8.5"       "5.8.5-pre4")
     (version-compare > "5.8.5-pre10" "5.8.5-pre4")

3.6 AutoGen Native Macros
=========================

This section describes the various AutoGen natively defined macros.
Unlike the Scheme functions, some of these macros are "block macros"
with a scope that extends through a terminating macro.  Block macros
must not overlap.  That is to say, a block macro started within the
scope of an encompassing block macro must have its matching end macro
appear before the encompassing block macro is either ended or
subdivided.

   The block macros are these:

`CASE'
     This macro has scope through the `ESAC' macro.  The scope is
     subdivided by `SELECT' macros.  You must have at least one
     `SELECT' macro.

`DEFINE'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDDEF' macro.  The defined user
     macro can never be a block macro.  This macro is extracted from
     the template before the template is processed.  Consequently, you
     cannot select a definition based on context.  You can, however,
     place them all at the end of the file.

`FOR'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDFOR' macro.

`IF'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDIF' macro.  The scope may be
     subdivided by `ELIF' and `ELSE' macros.  Obviously, there may be
     only one `ELSE' macro and it must be the last of these
     subdivisions.

`INCLUDE'
     This macro has the scope of the included file.  It is a block
     macro in the sense that the included file must not contain any
     incomplete block macros.

`WHILE'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDWHILE' macro.

3.6.1 AutoGen Macro Syntax
--------------------------

The general syntax is:

     [ { <native-macro-name> | <user-defined-name> } ] [ <arg> ... ]

The syntax for `<arg>' depends on the particular macro, but is
generally a full expression (*note expression syntax::).  Here are the
exceptions to that general rule:

  1. `INVOKE' macros, implicit or explicit, must be followed by a list
     of name/string value pairs.  The string values are simple
     expressions, as described above.

     That is, the `INVOKE' syntax is one of these two:
          <user-macro-name> [ <name> [ = <expression> ] ... ]

          INVOKE <name-expression> [ <name> [ = <expression> ] ... ]

  2. AutoGen FOR macros must be in one of three forms:

          FOR <name> [ <separator-string> ]

          FOR <name> (...Scheme expression list)

          FOR <name> IN <string-entry> [ ... ]
     where:
    `<name>'
          must be a simple name.

    `<separator-string>'
          is inserted between copies of the enclosed block.  Do not try
          to use "IN" as your separator string.  It won't work.

    `<string-entry>'
          is an entry in a list of strings.  "`<name>'" is assigned
          each value from the "`IN'" list before expanding the `FOR'
          block.

    `(...Scheme expression list)'
          is expected to contain one or more of the `for-from',
          `for-to', `for-by', and `for-sep' functions.  (*Note FOR::,
          and *note AutoGen Functions::)

     The first two forms iterate over the `FOR' block if `<name>' is
     found in the AutoGen values.  The last form will create the AutoGen
     value named `<name>'.

  3. AutoGen `DEFINE' macros must be followed by a simple name.
     Anything after that is ignored.  Consequently, that "comment space"
     may be used to document any named values the macro expects to have
     set up as arguments.  *Note DEFINE::.

  4. The AutoGen `COMMENT', `ELSE', `ESAC' and the `END*' macros take
     no arguments and ignore everything after the macro name (e.g. see
     *note COMMENT::)


File: autogen.info,  Node: CASE,  Next: COMMENT,  Prev: AGMacro syntax,  Up: native macros

3.6.2 CASE - Select one of several template blocks
--------------------------------------------------

The arguments are evaluated and converted to a string, if necessary.  A
simple name will be interpreted as an AutoGen value name and its value
will be used by the `SELECT' macros (see the example below and the
expression evaluation function, *note EXPR::).  The scope of the macro
is up to the matching `ESAC' macro.  Within the scope of a `CASE', this
string is matched against case selection macros.  There are sixteen
match macros that are derived from four different ways matches may be
performed, plus an "always true", "true if the AutoGen value was found",
and "true if no AutoGen value was found" matches.  The codes for the
nineteen match macros are formed as follows:

  1. Must the match start matching from the beginning of the string?
     If not, then the match macro code starts with an asterisk (`*').

  2. Must the match finish matching at the end of the string?  If not,
     then the match macro code ends with an asterisk (`*').

  3. Is the match a pattern match or a string comparison?  If a
     comparison, use an equal sign (`=').  If a pattern match, use a
     tilde (`~').

  4. Is the match case sensitive?  If alphabetic case is important,
     double the tilde or equal sign.

  5. Do you need a default match when none of the others match?  Use a
     single asterisk (`*').

  6. Do you need to distinguish between an empty string value and a
     value that was not found?  Use the non-existence test (`!E') before
     testing a full match against an empty string (`== ''').  There is
     also an existence test (`+E'), more for symmetry than for
     practical use.

For example:

     [+ CASE <full-expression> +]
     [+ ~~*  "[Tt]est" +]reg exp must match at start, not at end
     [+ ==   "TeSt"    +]a full-string, case sensitive compare
     [+ =    "TEST"    +]a full-string, case insensitive compare
     [+ !E             +]not exists - matches if no AutoGen value found
     [+ ==   ""        +]expression yielded a zero-length string
     [+ +E             +]exists - matches if there is any value result
     [+ *              +]always match - no testing
     [+ ESAC +]

   `<full-expression>' (*note expression syntax::) may be any
expression, including the use of apply-codes and value-names.  If the
expression yields a number, it is converted to a decimal string.

   These case selection codes have also been implemented as Scheme
expression functions using the same codes.  They are documented in this
texi doc as "string-*?" predicates (*note Common Functions::).


File: autogen.info,  Node: COMMENT,  Next: DEBUG,  Prev: CASE,  Up: native macros

3.6.3 COMMENT - A block of comment to be ignored
------------------------------------------------

This function can be specified by the user, but there will never be a
situation where it will be invoked at emit time.  The macro is actually
removed from the internal representation.

   If the native macro name code is `#', then the entire macro function
is treated as a comment and ignored.

     [+ # say what you want, but no '+' before any ']' chars +]


File: autogen.info,  Node: DEBUG,  Next: DEFINE,  Prev: COMMENT,  Up: native macros

3.6.4 DEBUG - Print debug message to trace output
-------------------------------------------------

If the tracing level is at "debug-message" or above (*note autogen
trace::), this macro prints a debug message to trace output.  This
message is not evaluated.  This macro can also be used to set useful
debugger breakpoints.  By inserting [+DEBUG n+] into your template, you
can set a debugger breakpoint on the #n case element below (in the
AutoGen source) and step through the processing of interesting parts of
your template.

   To be useful, you have to have access to the source tree where
autogen was built and the template being processed.  The definitions
are also helpful, but not crucial.  Please contact the author if you
think you might actually want to use this.


File: autogen.info,  Node: DEFINE,  Next: ELIF,  Prev: DEBUG,  Up: native macros

3.6.5 DEFINE - Define a user AutoGen macro
------------------------------------------

This function will define a new macro.  You must provide a name for the
macro.  You do not specify any arguments, though the invocation may
specify a set of name/value pairs that are to be active during the
processing of the macro.

     [+ define foo +]
     ... macro body with macro functions ...
     [+ enddef +]
     ... [+ foo bar='raw text' baz=<<text expression>> +]

   Once the macro has been defined, this new macro can be invoked by
specifying the macro name as the first token after the start macro
marker.  Alternatively, you may make the invocation explicitly invoke a
defined macro by specifying `INVOKE' (*note INVOKE::) in the macro
invocation.  If you do that, the macro name can be computed with an
expression that gets evaluated every time the INVOKE macro is
encountered.

   Any remaining text in the macro invocation will be used to create new
name/value pairs that only persist for the duration of the processing of
the macro.  The expressions are evaluated the same way basic
expressions are evaluated.  *Note expression syntax::.

   The resulting definitions are handled much like regular definitions,
except:

  1. The values may not be compound.  That is, they may not contain
     nested name/value pairs.

  2. The bindings go away when the macro is complete.

  3. The name/value pairs are separated by whitespace instead of
     semi-colons.

  4. Sequences of strings are not concatenated.

     *NB:* The macro is extracted from the template as the template is
     scanned.  You cannot conditionally define a macro by enclosing it
     in an `IF'/`ENDIF' (*note IF::) macro pair.  If you need to
     dynamically select the format of a `DEFINE'd macro, then put the
     flavors into separate template files that simply define macros.
     `INCLUDE' (*note INCLUDE::) the appropriate template when you have
     computed which you need.

   Due to this, it is acceptable and even a good idea to place all the
`DEFINE' macros at the end of the template.  That puts the main body of
the template at the beginning of the file.

3.6.13 EXPR - Evaluate and emit an Expression
---------------------------------------------

This macro does not have a name to cause it to be invoked explicitly,
though if a macro starts with one of the apply codes or one of the
simple expression markers, then an expression macro is inferred.  The
result of the expression evaluation (*note expression syntax::) is
written to the current output.


File: autogen.info,  Node: FOR,  Next: IF,  Prev: EXPR,  Up: native macros

3.6.14 FOR - Emit a template block multiple times
-------------------------------------------------

This macro has a slight variation on the standard syntax:
     FOR <value-name> [ <separator-string> ]

     FOR <value-name> (...Scheme expression list)

     FOR <value-name> IN "string" [ ... ]

   Other than for the last form, the first macro argument must be the
name of an AutoGen value.  If there is no value associated with the
name, the `FOR' template block is skipped entirely.  The scope of the
`FOR' macro extends to the corresponding `ENDFOR' macro.  The last form
will create an array of string values named `<value-name>' that only
exists within the context of this `FOR' loop.  With this form, in order
to use a `separator-string', you must code it into the end of the
template block using the `(last-for?)' predicate function (*note SCM
last-for?::).

   If there are any arguments after the `value-name', the initial
characters are used to determine the form.  If the first character is
either a semi-colon (`;') or an opening parenthesis (`('), then it is
presumed to be a Scheme expression containing the FOR macro specific
functions `for-from', `for-by', `for-to', and/or `for-sep'.  *Note
AutoGen Functions::.  If it consists of an '`i'' an '`n'' and separated
by white space from more text, then the `FOR x IN' form is processed.
Otherwise, the remaining text is presumed to be a string for inserting
between each iteration of the loop.  This string will be emitted one
time less than the number of iterations of the loop.  That is, it is
emitted after each loop, excepting for the last iteration.

   If the from/by/to functions are invoked, they will specify which
copies of the named value are to be processed.  If there is no copy of
the named value associated with a particular index, the `FOR' template
block will be instantiated anyway.  The template must use methods for
detecting missing definitions and emitting default text.  In this
fashion, you can insert entries from a sparse or non-zero based array
into a dense, zero based array.

   *NB:* the `for-from', `for-to', `for-by' and `for-sep' functions are
disabled outside of the context of the `FOR' macro.  Likewise, the
`first-for', `last-for' and `for-index' functions are disabled outside
of the range of a `FOR' block.

   *Also:* the `<value-name>' must be a single level name, not a
compound name (*note naming values::).

     [+FOR var (for-from 0) (for-to <number>) (for-sep ",") +]
     ... text with `var'ious substitutions ...[+
     ENDFOR var+]

this will repeat the `... text with `var'ious substitutions ...'
<number>+1 times.  Each repetition, except for the last, will have a
comma `,' after it.

     [+FOR var ",\n" +]
     ... text with `var'ious substitutions ...[+
     ENDFOR var +]

This will do the same thing, but only for the index values of `var'
that have actually been defined.

3.6.15 IF - Conditionally Emit a Template Block
-----------------------------------------------

Conditional block.  Its arguments are evaluated (*note EXPR::) and if
the result is non-zero or a string with one or more bytes, then the
condition is true and the text from that point until a matched `ELIF',
`ELSE' or `ENDIF' is emitted.  `ELIF' introduces a conditional
alternative if the `IF' clause evaluated FALSE and `ELSE' introduces an
unconditional alternative.

     [+IF <full-expression> +]
     emit things that are for the true condition[+

     ELIF <full-expression-2> +]
     emit things that are true maybe[+

     ELSE "This may be a comment" +]
     emit this if all but else fails[+

     ENDIF "This may *also* be a comment" +]

`<full-expression>' may be any expression described in the `EXPR'
expression function, including the use of apply-codes and value-names.
If the expression yields an empty string, it is interpreted as false.


File: autogen.info,  Node: INCLUDE,  Next: INVOKE,  Prev: IF,  Up: native macros

3.6.16 INCLUDE - Read in and emit a template block
--------------------------------------------------

The entire contents of the named file is inserted at this point.  The
contents of the file are processed for macro expansion.  The arguments
are eval-ed, so you may compute the name of the file to be included.
The included file must not contain any incomplete function blocks.
Function blocks are template text beginning with any of the macro
functions `CASE', `DEFINE', `FOR', `IF' and `WHILE'; extending through
their respective terminating macro functions.


File: autogen.info,  Node: INVOKE,  Next: SELECT,  Prev: INCLUDE,  Up: native macros

3.6.17 INVOKE - Invoke a User Defined Macro
-------------------------------------------

User defined macros may be invoked explicitly or implicitly.  If you
invoke one implicitly, the macro must begin with the name of the
defined macro.  Consequently, this may *not* be a computed value.  If
you explicitly invoke a user defined macro, the macro begins with the
macro name `INVOKE' followed by a basic expression that must yield a
known user defined macro.  A macro name _must_ be found, or AutoGen
will issue a diagnostic and exit.

   Arguments are passed to the invoked macro by name.  The text
following the macro name must consist of a series of names each of
which is followed by an equal sign (`=') and a basic expression that
yields a string.

   The string values may contain template macros that are parsed the
first time the macro is processed and evaluated again every time the
macro is evaluated.


File: autogen.info,  Node: SELECT,  Next: UNKNOWN,  Prev: INVOKE,  Up: native macros

3.6.18 SELECT - Selection block for CASE function
-------------------------------------------------

This macro selects a block of text by matching an expression against
the sample text expression evaluated in the `CASE' macro.  *Note CASE::.

   You do not specify a `SELECT' macro with the word "select".
Instead, you must use one of the 19 match operators described in the
`CASE' macro description.


File: autogen.info,  Node: UNKNOWN,  Next: WHILE,  Prev: SELECT,  Up: native macros

3.6.19 UNKNOWN - Either a user macro or a value name.
-----------------------------------------------------

The macro text has started with a name not known to AutoGen.  If, at run
time, it turns out to be the name of a defined macro, then that macro is
invoked.  If it is not, then it is a conditional expression that is
evaluated only if the name is defined at the time the macro is invoked.

   You may not specify `UNKNOWN' explicitly.


File: autogen.info,  Node: WHILE,  Prev: UNKNOWN,  Up: native macros

3.6.20 WHILE - Conditionally loop over a Template Block
-------------------------------------------------------

Conditionally repeated block.  Its arguments are evaluated (*note
EXPR::) and as long as the result is non-zero or a string with one or
more bytes, then the condition is true and the text from that point
until a matched `ENDWHILE' is emitted.

     [+WHILE <full-expression> +]
     emit things that are for the true condition[+

     ENDWHILE +]

`<full-expression>' may be any expression described in the `EXPR'
expression function, including the use of apply-codes and value-names.
If the expression yields an empty string, it is interpreted as false.

3.7 Redirecting Output
======================

AutoGen provides a means for redirecting the template output to
different files or, in `M4' parlance, to various diversions.  It is
accomplished by providing a set of Scheme functions named `out-*'
(*note AutoGen Functions::).

`out-push-new (*note SCM out-push-new::)'
     This allows you to logically "push" output files onto a stack.  If
     you supply a string name, then a file by that name is created to
     hold the output.  If you do not supply a name, then the text is
     written to a scratch pad and retrieved by passing a "`#t'" argument
     to the `out-pop' (*note SCM out-pop::) function.

`out-pop (*note SCM out-pop::)'
     This function closes the current output file and resumes output to
     the next one in the stack.  At least one output must have been
     pushed onto the output stack with the `out-push-new' (*note SCM
     out-push-new::) function.  If "`#t'" is passed in as an argument,
     then the entire contents of the diversion (or file) is returned.

`out-suspend (*note SCM out-suspend::)'
     This function does not close the current output, but instead sets
     it aside for resumption by the given name with `out-resume'.  The
     current output must have been pushed on the output queue with
     `out-push-new' (*note SCM out-push-new::).

`out-resume (*note SCM out-resume::)'
     This will put a named file descriptor back onto the top of stack
     so that it becomes the current output again.

`out-switch (*note SCM out-switch::)'
     This closes the current output and creates a new file, purging any
     preexisting one.  This is a shortcut for "pop" followed by "push",
     but this can also be done at the base level.

`out-move (*note SCM out-move::)'
     Renames the current output file without closing it.

   There are also several functions for determining the output status.
*Note AutoGen Functions::.

4 Augmenting AutoGen Features
*****************************

AutoGen was designed to be simple to enhance.  You can do it by
providing shell commands, Guile/Scheme macros or callout functions that
can be invoked as a Guile macro.  Here is how you do these.

* Menu:

* shell commands::       Shell Output Commands
* guile macros::         Guile Macros
* guile callouts::       Guile Callout Functions
* AutoGen macros::       AutoGen Macros


File: autogen.info,  Node: shell commands,  Next: guile macros,  Up: Augmenting AutoGen

4.1 Shell Output Commands
=========================

Shell commands are run inside of a server process.  This means that,
unlike `make', context is kept from one command to the next.
Consequently, you can define a shell function in one place inside of
your template and invoke it in another.  You may also store values in
shell variables for later reference.  If you load functions from a file
containing shell functions, they will remain until AutoGen exits.

   If your shell script should determine that AutoGen should stop
processing, the recommended method for stopping AutoGen is:
     die "some error text"

That is a shell function added by AutoGen.  It will send a SIGTERM to
autogen and exit from the "persistent" shell.


File: autogen.info,  Node: guile macros,  Next: guile callouts,  Prev: shell commands,  Up: Augmenting AutoGen

4.2 Guile Macros
================

Guile also maintains context from one command to the next.  This means
you may define functions and variables in one place and reference them
elsewhere.  You also may load Guile macro definitions from a Scheme
file by using the `--load-scheme' command line option (*note autogen
load-scheme::).  Beware, however, that the AutoGen specific scheme
functions have not been loaded at this time, so though you may define
functions that reference them, do not invoke the AutoGen functions at
this time.

   If your Scheme script should determine that AutoGen should stop
processing, the recommended method for stopping AutoGen is:
     (error "some error text")


File: autogen.info,  Node: guile callouts,  Next: AutoGen macros,  Prev: guile macros,  Up: Augmenting AutoGen

4.3 Guile Callout Functions
===========================

Callout functions must be registered with Guile to work.  This can be
accomplished either by putting your routines into a shared library that
contains a `void scm_init( void )' routine that registers these
routines, or by building them into AutoGen.

   To build them into AutoGen, you must place your routines in the
source directory and name the files `exp*.c'.  You also must have a
stylized comment that `getdefs' can find that conforms to the following:

     /*=gfunc <function-name>
      *
      *  what:    <short one-liner>
      *  general_use:
      *  string:  <invocation-name-string>
      *  exparg:  <name>, <description> [, ['optional'] [, 'list']]
      *  doc:     A long description telling people how to use
      *           this function.
     =*/
     SCM
     ag_scm_<function-name>( SCM arg_name[, ...] )
     { <code> }

`gfunc'
     You must have this exactly thus.

`<function-name>'
     This must follow C syntax for variable names

`<short one-liner>'
     This should be about a half a line long.  It is used as a
     subsection title in this document.

`general_use:'
     You must supply this unless you are an AutoGen maintainer and are
     writing a function that queries or modifies the state of AutoGen.

`<invocation-name-string>'
     Normally, the `function-name' string will be transformed into a
     reasonable invocation name.  However, that is not always true.  If
     the result does not suit your needs, then supply an alternate
     string.

`exparg:'
     You must supply one for each argument to your function.  All
     optional arguments must be last.  The last of the optional
     arguments may be a list, if you choose.

`doc:'
     Please say something meaningful.

`[, ...]'
     Do not actually specify an ANSI ellipsis here.  You must provide
     for all the arguments you specified with `exparg'.

   See the Guile documentation for more details.  More information is
also available in a large comment at the beginning of the
`agen5/snarf.tpl' template file.

4.4 AutoGen Macros
==================

There are two kinds  those you define yourself and AutoGen native.  The
user-defined macros may be defined in your templates or loaded with the
`--lib-template' option (See *note DEFINE:: and  *note autogen
lib-template::).

   As for AutoGen native macros, do not add any. It is easy to do, but I
won't like it.  The basic functions needed to accomplish looping over
and selecting blocks of text have proved to be sufficient over a period
of several years.  New text transformations can be easily added via any
of the AutoGen extension methods, as discussed above.

5 Invoking autogen
******************

AutoGen creates text files from templates using external definitions.
AutoGen is a tool designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.

   The definitions (`<def-file>') can be specified with the
`definitions' option or as the command argument, but not both.
Omitting it or specifying `-' will result in reading definitions from
standard input.

   The output file names are based on the template, but generally use
the base name of the definition file.  If standard in is read for the
definitions, then `stdin' will be used for that base name.  The
suffixes to the base name are gotten from the template.  However, the
template file may specify the entire output file name.  The generated
files are always created in the current directory.  If you need to
place output in an alternate directory, `cd' to that directory and use
the `--templ_dirs' option to search the original directory.

   `loop-limit' is used in debugging to stop runaway expansions.

5.2 base-name option (-b)
=========================

This is the "base name for output file(s)" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   A template may specify the exact name of the output file.  Normally,
it does not.  Instead, the name is composed of the base name of the
definitions file with suffixes appended.  This option will override the
base name derived from the definitions file name.  This is required if
there is no definitions file and advisable if definitions are being
read from stdin.  If the definitions are being read from standard in,
the base name defaults to `stdin'.  Any leading directory components in
the name will be silently removed.  If you wish the output file to
appear in a particular directory, it is recommended that you "cd" into
that directory first, or use directory names in the format specification
for the output suffix lists, *Note pseudo macro::.

5.3 core option (-C)
====================

This is the "leave a core dump on a failure exit" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H' during the
     compilation.

   Many systems default to a zero sized core limit.  If the system has
the sys/resource.h header and if this option is supplied, then in the
failure exit path, autogen will attempt to set the soft core limit to
whatever the hard core limit is.  If that does not work, then an
administrator must raise the hard core size limit.

5.4 define option (-D)
======================

This is the "name to add to definition list" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   The AutoGen define names are used for the following purposes:

  1. Sections of the AutoGen definitions may be enabled or disabled by
     using C-style #ifdef and #ifndef directives.

  2. When defining a value for a name, you may specify the index for a
     particular value.  That index may be a literal value, a define
     option or a value #define-d in the definitions themselves.

  3. The name of a file may be prefixed with `$NAME/'.  The `$NAME'
     part of the name string will be replaced with the define-d value
     for `NAME'.

  4. When AutoGen is finished loading the definitions, the defined
     values are exported to the environment with, `putenv(3)'.  These
     values can then be used in shell scripts with `${NAME}' references
     and in templates with `(getenv "NAME")'.

  5. While processing a template, you may specify an index to retrieve
     a specific value.  That index may also be a define-d value.

   It is entirely equivalent to place this name in the exported
environment.  Internally, that is what AutoGen actually does with this
option.

5.5 definitions option
======================

This is the "definitions input file" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * is enabled by default.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   Use this argument to specify the input definitions file with a
command line option.  If you do not specify this option, then there
must be a command line argument that specifies the file, even if only
to specify stdin with a hyphen (`-').  Specify, `--no-definitions' when
you wish to process a template without any active AutoGen definitions.\n

5.6 equate option
=================

This is the "characters considered equivalent" option.  This option
will alter the list of characters considered equivalent.  The default
are the three characters, "_-^".  (The last is conventional on a
Tandem/HP-NonStop, and I used to do a lot of work on Tandems.)


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen lib-template,  Next: autogen load-functions,  Prev: autogen equate,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.7 lib-template option (-l)
============================

This is the "library template file" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   DEFINE macros are saved from this template file for use in processing
the main macro file.  Template text aside from the DEFINE macros is is
ignored.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen load-functions,  Next: autogen load-scheme,  Prev: autogen lib-template,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.8 load-functions option (-F)
==============================

This is the "load scheme function library" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `HAVE_DLOPEN' during the
     compilation.

   This option is used to load Guile-scheme functions.  The
automatically called initialization routine `scm_init' must be used to
register these routines or data.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen load-scheme,  Next: autogen loop-limit,  Prev: autogen load-functions,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.9 load-scheme option (-S)
===========================

This is the "scheme code file to load" option.  Use this option to
pre-load Scheme scripts into the Guile interpreter before template
processing begins.  Please note that the AutoGen specific functions are
not loaded until after argument processing.  So, though they may be
specified in lambda functions you define, they may not be invoked until
after option processing is complete.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen loop-limit,  Next: autogen make-dep,  Prev: autogen load-scheme,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.10 loop-limit option
======================

This is the "limit on increment loops" option.  This option prevents
runaway loops.  For example, if you accidentally specify, "FOR x
(for-from 1) (for-to -1) (for-by 1)", it will take a long time to
finish.  If you do have more than 256 entries in tables, you will need
to specify a new limit with this option.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen make-dep,  Next: autogen no-fmemopen,  Prev: autogen loop-limit,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.11 make-dep option (-M)
=========================

This is the "emit make dependency file" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   This option behaves fairly closely to the way the `-M' series of
options work with the gcc compiler, except that instead of just
emitting the predecessor dependencies, this also emits the successor
dependencies (output target files).  By default, the output dependency
information will be placed in `<base-name>.d', but may also be
specified with `-MF<file>'.  The time stamp on this file will be
manipulated so that it will be one second older than the oldest primary
output file.

   The target in this dependency file will normally be the dependency
file name, but may also be overridden with `-MT<targ-name>'.  AutoGen
will not alter the contents of that file, but it may create it and it
will adjust the modification time to match the start time.

   *NB:* these second letters are part of the option argument, so `-MF
<file>' must have the space character quoted or omitted, and `-M "F
<file>"' is acceptable because the `F' is part of the option argument.

   `-M' may be followed by any of the letters M, F, P, T, Q, D, or G.
However, only F and T are meaningful and the latter has a somewhat
different meaning: `-MT<name>' is interpreted as meaning `<name>' is a
sentinel file that will depend on all inputs (templates and definition
files) and all the output files will depend on this sentinel file.  It
is suitable for use as a real make target.

   This is the recommended usage:
    -MFwhatever-you-like.dep -MTyour-sentinel-file
   and then in your `Makefile', make the `autogen' rule:
    -include whatever-you-like.dep
    your-sentinel-file:
        autogen -MT$@ -MF$*.d .....

   The modification time on the dependency file is adjusted to be one
second before the earliest time stamp of any other output file.
Consequently, it is suitable for use as the sentinel file testifying to
the fact the program was successfully run.  (`-include' is the GNU make
way of specifying "include it if it exists".  Your make must support
that feature or your bootstrap process must create the file.)

   All of this may also be specified using the `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' or
`AUTOGEN_MAKE_DEP' environment variables.  If defined, dependency
information will be output.  If defined with white space free text that
is something other than `true', `false', `yes', `no', `0' or `1', then
the string is taken to be an output file name.  If it contains a string
of white space characters, the first token is as above and the second
token is taken to be the target (sentinel) file as `-MT' in the
paragraphs above.  `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' will be ignored if there are
multiple sequences of white space characters or if its contents are,
specifically, `false', `no' or `0'.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen no-fmemopen,  Next: autogen override-tpl,  Prev: autogen make-dep,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.12 no-fmemopen option (-m)
============================

This is the "do not use in-mem streams" option.  If the local C library
supports "`fopencookie(3GNU)'", or "`funopen(3BSD)'" then AutoGen
prefers to use in-memory stream buffer opens instead of anonymous
files.  This may lead to problems if there is a shortage of virtual
memory.  If, for a particular application, you run out of memory, then
specify this option.  This is unlikely in a modern 64-bit virtual
memory environment.

   On platforms without these functions, the option is accepted but
ignored.  `fmemopen(POSIX)' is not adequate because its string buffer
is not reallocatable.  `open_memstream(POSIX)' is also not adequate
because the stream is only opened for output.  AutoGen needs a
reallocatable buffer available for both reading and writing.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen override-tpl,  Next: autogen select-suffix,  Prev: autogen no-fmemopen,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.13 override-tpl option (-T)
=============================

This is the "override template file" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   Definition files specify the standard template that is to be
expanded.  This option will override that name and expand a different
template.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen select-suffix,  Next: autogen shell,  Prev: autogen override-tpl,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.14 select-suffix option (-o)
==============================

This is the "specify this output suffix" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   If you wish to override the suffix specifications in the template,
you can use one or more copies of this option.  See the suffix
specification in the *note pseudo macro:: section of the info doc.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen shell,  Next: autogen show-defs,  Prev: autogen select-suffix,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.15 shell option
=================

This is the "name or path name of shell to use" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `SHELL_ENABLED' during the
     compilation.

   By default, when AutoGen is built, the configuration is probed for a
reasonable Bourne-like shell to use for shell script processing.  If a
particular template needs an alternate shell, it must be specified with
this option on the command line, with an environment variable (`SHELL')
or in the configuration/initialization file.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen show-defs,  Next: autogen skip-suffix,  Prev: autogen shell,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.16 show-defs option
=====================

This is the "show the definition tree" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `DEBUG_ENABLED' during the
     compilation.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   This will print out the complete definition tree before processing
the template.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen skip-suffix,  Next: autogen source-time,  Prev: autogen show-defs,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.17 skip-suffix option (-s)
============================

This is the "omit the file with this suffix" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   * must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
     select-suffix.

   Occasionally, it may not be desirable to produce all of the output
files specified in the template.  (For example, only the `.h' header
file, but not the `.c' program text.)  To do this specify
`--skip-suffix=c' on the command line.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen source-time,  Next: autogen templ-dirs,  Prev: autogen skip-suffix,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.18 source-time option
=======================

This is the "set mod times to latest source" option.  If you stamp your
output files with the `DNE' macro output, then your output files will
always be different, even if the content has not really changed.  If
you use this option, then the modification time of the output files
will change only if the input files change.  This will help reduce
unneeded builds.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen templ-dirs,  Next: autogen timeout,  Prev: autogen source-time,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.19 templ-dirs option (-L)
===========================

This is the "template search directory list" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   Add a directory to the list of directories to search when opening a
template, either as the primary template or an included one.  The last
entry has the highest priority in the search list.  That is to say,
they are searched in reverse order.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen timeout,  Next: autogen trace,  Prev: autogen templ-dirs,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.20 timeout option (-t)
========================

This is the "time limit for server shell" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `SHELL_ENABLED' during the
     compilation.

   AutoGen works with a shell server process.  Most normal commands will
complete in less than 10 seconds.  If, however, your commands need more
time than this, use this option.

   The valid range is 0 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).  Zero will disable
the server time limit.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen trace,  Next: autogen trace-out,  Prev: autogen timeout,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.21 trace option
=================

This is the "tracing level of detail" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * This option takes a keyword as its argument.  The argument sets an
     enumeration value that can be tested by comparing the option value
     macro (OPT_VALUE_TRACE).  The available keywords are:
             nothing       debug-message server-shell
             templates     block-macros  expressions
             everything

     or their numeric equivalent.

   This option will cause AutoGen to display a trace of its template
processing.  There are six levels, each level including messages from
the previous levels:

`nothing'
     Does no tracing at all (default)

`debug-message'
     Print messages from the "DEBUG" AutoGen macro (*note DEBUG::).

`server-shell'
     Traces all input and output to the server shell.  This includes a
     shell "independent" initialization script about 30 lines long.
     Its output is discarded and not inserted into any template.

`templates'
     Traces the invocation of `DEFINE'd macros and `INCLUDE's

`block-macros'
     Traces all block macros.  The above, plus `IF', `FOR', `CASE' and
     `WHILE'.

`expressions'
     Displays the results of expression evaluations.

`everything'
     Displays the invocation of every AutoGen macro, even `TEXT' macros
     (i.e. the text outside of macro quotes).  Additionally, if you
     rebuild the "expr.ini" file with debugging enabled, then all calls
     to AutoGen defined scheme functions will also get logged:
         cd ${top_builddir}/agen5
         DEBUG_ENABLED=true bash bootstrap.dir expr.ini
         make CFLAGS='-g -DDEBUG_ENABLED=1'

     Be aware that you cannot rebuild this source in this way without
     first having installed the `autogen' executable in your search
     path.  Because of this, "expr.ini" is in the distributed source
     list, and not in the dependencies.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen trace-out,  Next: autogen undefine,  Prev: autogen trace,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.22 trace-out option
=====================

This is the "tracing output file or filter" option.  The output
specified may be a file name, a file that is appended to, or, if the
option argument begins with the `pipe' operator (`|'), a command that
will receive the tracing output as standard in.  For example,
`--traceout='| less'' will run the trace output through the `less'
program.  Appending to a file is specified by preceeding the file name
with two greater-than characters (`>>').


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen undefine,  Next: autogen used-defines,  Prev: autogen trace-out,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.23 undefine option (-U)
=========================

This is the "definition list removal pattern" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   Similar to 'C', AutoGen uses `#ifdef/#ifndef' preprocessing
directives.  This option will cause the matching names to be removed
from the list of defined values.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen used-defines,  Next: autogen writable,  Prev: autogen undefine,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.24 used-defines option
========================

This is the "show the definitions used" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   This will print out the names of definition values searched for
during the processing of the template, whether actually found or not.
There may be other referenced definitions in a template in portions of
the template not evaluated.  Some of the names listed may be computed
names and others AutoGen macro arguments.  This is not a means for
producing a definitive, all-encompassing list of all and only the
values used from a definition file.  This is intended as an aid to
template documentation only.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen writable,  Next: autogen option presets,  Prev: autogen used-defines,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.25 writable option
====================

This is the "allow output files to be writable" option.  This option
will leave output files writable.  Normally, output files are read-only.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen option presets,  Next: autogen Description,  Prev: autogen writable,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.26 presetting/configuring autogen
===================================

Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files, and values
from environment variables named `AUTOGEN' and `AUTOGEN_<OPTION_NAME>'.
`<OPTION_NAME>' must be one of the options listed above in upper case
and segmented with underscores.  The `AUTOGEN' variable will be
tokenized and parsed like the command line.  The remaining variables
are tested for existence and their values are treated like option
arguments.

   `libopts' will search in 2 places for configuration files:
     item $HOME

     item $PWD

   The environment variables `HOME', and `PWD' are expanded and
replaced when `autogen' runs.  For any of these that are plain files,
they are simply processed.  For any that are directories, then a file
named `.autogenrc' is searched for within that directory and processed.

   Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats.  The basic
format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the same
line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon, equal
sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

   Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file.
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
    [AUTOGEN]
   or by
    <?program autogen>
   Do not mix these within one configuration file.

   Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
    <option-name>
       <sub-opt>...&lt;...&gt;...</sub-opt>
    </option-name>
   yielding an `option-name.sub-opt' string value of
    "...<...>..."
   `AutoOpts' does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  `AutoOpts' does provide a means for
searching the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen exit status,  Prev: autogen Examples,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.27 autogen exit status
========================

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0'
     Successful program execution.

`1'
     The command options were misconfigured.

`2'
     An error was encountered processing the template.

`3'
     The definitions could not be deciphered.

`4'
     An error was encountered during the load phase.

`5'
     Program exited due to catching a signal.  If your template includes
     string formatting, a number argument to a "%s" formatting element
     will trigger a segmentation fault.  Autogen will catch the seg
     fault signal and exit with `AUTOGEN_EXIT_SIGNAL(5)'.
     Alternatively, AutoGen may have been interrupted with a `kill(2)'
     signal.


File: autogen.info,  Node: autogen Description,  Next: autogen Examples,  Prev: autogen option presets,  Up: autogen Invocation

5.28 autogen Description
========================

`AutoGen' is designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.  The goal is to simplify the
maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
This is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text
that must be kept synchronized.

   One common example is the problem of maintaining the code required
for processing program options.  Processing options requires a minimum
of four different constructs be kept in proper order in different places
in your program.  You need at least: The flag character in the flag
string, code to process the flag when it is encountered, a global state
variable or two, and a line in the usage text.  You will need more
things besides this if you choose to implement long option names,
configuration file processing, environment variables and so on.

   All of this can be done mechanically; with the proper templates and
this program.

5.29 autogen Examples
=====================

Here is how the man page is produced:
    autogen -Tagman-cmd.tpl -MFman-dep -MTstamp-man opts.def

   This command produced this man page from the AutoGen option
definition file.  It overrides the template specified in `opts.def'
(normally `options.tpl') and uses `agman-cmd.tpl'.  It also sets the
make file dependency output to `man-dep' and the sentinel file (time
stamp file) to `man-stamp'.  The base of the file name is derived from
the defined `prog-name'.

   The texi invocation document is produced via:
    autogen -Tagtexi-cmd.tpl -MFtexi-dep -MTtexi-stamp opts.def

* installing::     Installing AutoGen


File: autogen.info,  Node: configuring,  Next: AutoGen CGI,  Up: Installation

6.1 Configuring AutoGen
=======================

AutoGen is configured and built using Libtool, Automake and Autoconf.
Consequently, you can install it wherever you wish using the various
`--prefix' options.  To the various configuration options supplied by
these tools, AutoGen adds a few of its own:

`--disable-shell'
     AutoGen is now capable of acting as a CGI forms server, *Note
     AutoGen CGI::.  As such, it will gather its definitions using
     either `GET' or `POST' methods.  All you need to do is have a
     template named `cgi.tpl' handy or specify a different one with a
     command line option.

     However, doing this without disabling the server shell brings
     considerable risk.  If you were to pass user input to a script
     that contained, say, the classic "``rm -rf /`'", you might have a
     problem.  This configuration option will cause shell template
     commands to simply return the command string as the result.  No
     mistakes.  Much safer.  Strongly recommended.  The default is to
     have server shell scripting enabled.

     Disabling the shell will have some build side effects, too.

        * Many of the make check tests will fail, since they assume a
          working server shell.

        * The getdefs and columns programs are not built.  The options
          are distributed as definition files and they cannot be
          expanded with a shell-disabled AutoGen.

        * Similarly, the documentation cannot be regenerated because
          the documentation templates depend on subshell functionality.

`--enable-debug'
     Turning on AutoGen debugging enables very detailed inspection of
     the input definitions and monitoring shell script processing.
     These options are not particularly useful to anyone not directly
     involved in maintaining AutoGen.  If you do choose to enable
     AutoGen debugging, be aware that the usage page was generated
     without these options, so when the build process reaches the
     documentation rebuild, there will be a failure.  `cd' into the
     `agen5' build directory, `make' the `autogen.texi' file and all
     will be well thereafter.

`--with-regex-header'
`--with-header-path'
`--with-regex-lib'
     These three work together to specify how to compile with and link
     to a particular POSIX regular expression library.  The value for
     `--with-regex-header=value' must be the name of the relevant header
     file.  The AutoGen sources will attempt to include that source with
     a `#include <value>' C preprocessing statement.  The `path' from
     the `--with-header-path=path' will be added to `CPPFLAGS' as
     `-Ipath'.  The `lib-specs' from `--with-regex-lib=lib-specs' will
     be added to `LDFLAGS' without any adornment.


File: autogen.info,  Node: AutoGen CGI,  Next: signal names,  Prev: configuring,  Up: Installation

6.2 AutoGen as a CGI server
===========================

AutoGen is now capable of acting as a CGI forms server.  It behaves as
a CGI server if the definitions input is from stdin and the environment
variable `REQUEST_METHOD' is defined and set to either "GET" or "POST".
If set to anything else, AutoGen will exit with a failure message.
When set to one of those values, the CGI data will be converted to
AutoGen definitions (*note Definitions File::) and the template named
"`cgi.tpl'" will be processed.

   This works by including the name of the real template to process in
the form data and having the "`cgi.tpl'" template include that template
for processing.  I do this for processing the form
`http://autogen.sourceforge.net/conftest.html'.  The "`cgi.tpl'" looks
approximately like this:

    <? AutoGen5 Template ?>
    <?
    IF (not (exist? "template"))                       ?><?
      form-error                                       ?><?

    ELIF (=* (get "template") "/")                     ?><?
      form-error                                       ?><?

    ELIF (define tpl-file (string-append "cgi-tpl/"
                          (get "template")))
         (access? tpl-file R_OK)                       ?><?
      INCLUDE (. tpl-file)                             ?><?

    ELIF (set! tpl-file (string-append tpl-file ".tpl"))
         (access? tpl-file R_OK)                       ?><?
      INCLUDE (. tpl-file)                             ?><?

    ELSE                                               ?><?
      form-error                                       ?><?
    ENDIF                                              ?>

This forces the template to be found in the "`cgi-tpl/'" directory.
Note also that there is no suffix specified in the pseudo macro (*note
pseudo macro::).  That tells AutoGen to emit the output to `stdout'.

   The output is actually spooled until it is complete so that, in the
case of an error, the output can be discarded and a proper error
message can be written in its stead.

   *Please also note* that it is advisable, _especially_ for network
accessible machines, to configure AutoGen (*note configuring::) with
shell processing disabled (`--disable-shell').  That will make it
impossible for any referenced template to hand data to a subshell for
interpretation.

6.3 Signal Names
================

When AutoGen is first built, it tries to use `psignal(3)',
`sys_siglist', `strsigno(3)' and `strsignal(3)' from the host operating
system.  If your system does not supply these, the AutoGen distribution
will.  However, it will use the distributed mapping and this mapping is
unlikely to match what your system uses.  This can be fixed.  Once you
have installed autogen, the mapping can be rebuilt on the host
operating system.  To do so, you must perform the following steps:

  1. Build and install AutoGen in a place where it will be found in your
     search path.

  2. `cd ${top_srcdir}/compat'

  3. `autogen strsignal.def'

  4. Verify the results by examining the `strsignal.h' file produced.

  5. Re-build and re-install AutoGen.

   If you have any problems or peculiarities that cause this process to
fail on your platform, please send me copies of the header files
containing the signal names and numbers, along with the full path names
of these files.  I will endeavor to fix it.  There is a shell script
inside of `strsignal.def' that tries to hunt down the information.

6.4 Installing AutoGen
======================

There are several files that get installed.  The number depend whether
or not both shared and archive libraries are to be installed.  The
following assumes that everything is installed relative to `$prefix'.
You can, of course, use `configure' to place these files where you wish.

   *NB*  AutoGen does not contain any compiled-in path names.  All
support directories are located via option processing, the environment
variable `HOME' or finding the directory where the executable came from.

   The installed files are:

  1. The executables in `bin' (autogen, getdefs and columns).

  2. The AutoOpts link libraries as `lib/libopts.*'.

  3. An include file in `include/options.h', needed for Automated
     Option Processing (see next chapter).

  4. Several template files and a scheme script in `share/autogen',
     needed for Automated Option Processing (*note AutoOpts::), parsing
     definitions written with scheme syntax (*note Dynamic Text::), the
     templates for producing documentation for your program (*note
     documentation attributes::), autoconf test macros, and AutoFSM.

  5. Info-style help files as `info/autogen.info*'.  These files
     document AutoGen, the option processing library AutoOpts, and
     several add-on components.

  6. The three man pages for the three executables are installed in
     man/man1.

   This program, library and supporting files can be installed with
three commands:

   * <src-dir>/configure [ <configure-options> ]

   * make

   * make install

   However, you may wish to insert `make check' before the `make
install' command.

   If you do perform a `make check' and there are any failures, you
will find the results in `<module>/test/FAILURES'.  Needless to say, I
would be interested in seeing the contents of those files and any
associated messages.  If you choose to go on and analyze one of these
failures, you will need to invoke the test scripts individually.  You
may do so by specifying the test (or list of test) in the TESTS make
variable, thus:

    gmake TESTS=test-name.test check

   I specify `gmake' because most makes will not let you override
internal definitions with command line arguments.  `gmake' does.

   All of the AutoGen tests are written to honor the contents of the
VERBOSE environment variable.  Normally, any commentary generated
during a test run is discarded unless the VERBOSE environment variable
is set.  So, to see what is happening during the test, you might invoke
the following with bash or ksh:

    VERBOSE=1 gmake TESTS="for.test forcomma.test" check

Or equivalently with csh:

    env VERBOSE=1 gmake TESTS="for.test forcomma.test" check

7 Automated Option Processing
*****************************

AutoOpts 36.3 is bundled with AutoGen.  It is a tool that virtually
eliminates the hassle of processing options and keeping man pages, info
docs and usage text up to date.  This package allows you to specify
several program attributes, up to a hundred option types and many
option attributes.  From this, it then produces all the code necessary
to parse and handle the command line and configuration file options,
and the documentation that should go with your program as well.

   All the features notwithstanding, some applications simply have
well-established command line interfaces.  Even still, those programs
may use the configuration file parsing portion of the library.  See the
"AutoOpts Features" and "Configuration File Format" sections.

7.1 AutoOpts Features
=====================

AutoOpts supports option processing; option state saving; and program
documentation with innumerable features.  Here, we list a few obvious
ones and some important ones, but the full list is really defined by
all the attributes defined in the *note Option Definitions:: section.

  1. POSIX-compliant short (flag) option processing.

  2. GNU-style long options processing.  Long options are recognized
     without case sensitivity, and they may be abbreviated.

  3. Environment variable initializations, *Note environrc::.

  4. Initialization from configuration files (aka RC or INI files), and
     saving the option state back into one, *Note loading rcfile::.

  5. Config files may be partitioned.  One config file may be used by
     several programs by partitioning it with lines containing,
     "`[PROGRAM_NAME]'" or "`<?program-name>'", *Note loading rcfile::.

  6. Config files may contain AutoOpts directives.  "`<?auto-options
     [[option-text]]>'" may be used to set `AutoOpts' option processing
     options.  Viz., `GNU' usage layout versus `AutoOpts' conventional
     layout, and `misuse-usage' versus `no-misuse-usage', *Note usage
     attributes::.

  7. Options may be marked as `dis-abled' with a disablement prefix.
     Such options may default to either an enabled or a disabled state.
     You may also provide an enablement prefix, too, e.g.,
     `--allow-mumble' and `--prevent-mumble' (*note Common
     Attributes::).

  8. Verify that required options are present between the minimum and
     maximum number of times on the command line.  Verify that
     conflicting options do not appear together.  Verify that options
     requiring the presence of other options are, in fact, used in the
     presence of other options.  See *Note Common Attributes::, and
     *Note Option Conflict Attributes::.

  9. There are several *note automatically supported options: automatic
     options.  They will have short flags if any options have option
     flags and the flags are not suppressed.  The associated flag may
     be altered or suppressed by specifying no value or an alternate
     character for "`xxx-value;'" in the option definition file.
     "`xxx'" is the name of the option below:

    `--help'
    `--more-help'
          These are always available.  `--more-help' will pass the full
          usage text through a pager.

    `--usage'
          This is added to the option list if `usage-opt' is specified.
          It yields the abbreviated usage to `stdout'.

    `--version'
          This is added to the option list if `version = xxx;' is
          specified.

    `--load-opts'
    `--save-opts'
          These are added to the option list if `homerc' is specified.
          Mostly.  If, `disable-save' is specified, then `--save-opts'
          is disabled.

 10. Various forms of main procedures can be added to the output, *Note
     Generated main::.  There are four basic forms:

       a. A program that processes the arguments and writes to standard
          out portable shell commands containing the digested options.

       b. A program that will generate portable shell commands to parse
          the defined options.  The expectation is that this result
          will be copied into a shell script and used there.

       c. A "for-each" main that will invoke a named function once for
          either each non-option argument on the command line or, if
          there are none, then once for each non-blank, non-comment
          input line read from stdin.

       d. A main procedure of your own design.  Its code can be
          supplied in the option description template or by
          incorporating another template.

 11. There are several methods for handling option arguments.
        * nothing (*note OPT_ARG::) option argument strings are
          globally available.

        * user supplied (*note Option Argument Handling::)

        * stack option arguments (*note Option Argument Handling::)

        * integer numbers (*note arg-type number::)

        * true or false valued (*note arg-type boolean::)

        * enumerated list of names (*note arg-type keyword::)

        * an enumeration (membership) set (*note arg-type set
          membership::)

        * a list of name/value pairs (option "subopts") (*note arg-type
          hierarchy::)

        * a time duration or a specific time and date

        * validated file name (*note arg-type file name::)

        * optional option argument (*note arg-optional::)

 12. The generated usage text can be emitted in either AutoOpts standard
     format (maximizing the information about each option), or GNU-ish
     normal form.  The default form is selected by either specifying or
     not specifying the `gnu-usage' attribute (*note information
     attributes::).  This can be overridden by the user himself with the
     `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment variable.  If it exists and is set to
     the string `gnu', it will force GNU-ish style format; if it is set
     to the string `autoopts', it will force AutoOpts standard format;
     otherwise, it will have no effect.

 13. The usage text and many other strings are stored in a single
     character array (*note string table functions: SCM
     string-table-new.).  This reduces fixup costs when loading the
     program or library.  The downside is that if GCC detects that any
     of these strings are used in a printf format, you may get the
     warning, `embedded '\0' in format'.  To eliminate the warning, you
     must provide GCC with the `-Wno-format-contains-nul' option.

 14. If you compile with `ENABLE_NLS' defined and `_()' defined to a
     localization function such as `gettext(3GNU)', then the option
     processing code will be localizable (*note i18n::).

 15. Provides a callable routine to parse a text string as if it were
     from one of the rc/ini/config files, hereafter referred to as a
     configuration file.

 16. By adding a `doc' and `arg-name' attributes to each option,
     AutoGen will also be able to produce a man page and the `invoking'
     section of a texinfo document.

 17. Intermingled option processing.  AutoOpts options may be
     intermingled with command line operands and options processed with
     other parsing techniques.  This is accomplished by setting the
     `allow-errors' (*note program attributes::) attribute.  When
     processing reaches a point where `optionProcess' (*note
     libopts-optionProcess::) needs to be called again, the current
     option can be set with `RESTART_OPT(n)' (*note RESTART_OPT::)
     before calling `optionProcess'.

     See: *Note library attributes::.

 18. Library suppliers can specify command line options that their
     client programs will accept.  They specify option definitions that
     get `#include'-d into the client option definitions and they
     specify an "anchor" option that has a callback and must be invoked.
     That will give the library access to the option state for their
     options.

 19. library options.  An AutoOpt-ed library may export its options for
     use in an AutoOpt-ed program.  This is done by providing an option
     definition file that client programs `#include' into their own
     option definitions.  See "AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed
     Program" (*note lib and program::) for more details.

7.2 AutoOpts Licensing
======================

When AutoGen is installed, the AutoOpts project is installed with it.
AutoOpts includes various AutoGen templates and a pair of shared
libraries.  These libraries may be used under the terms of version 3 of
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

   One of these libraries (`libopts') is needed by programs that are
built using AutoOpts generated code.  This library is available as a
separate "tear-off" source tarball.  It is redistributable for use
under either of two licenses: The above mentioned GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the advertising-clause-free BSD license.  Both of
these license terms are incorporated into appropriate COPYING files
included with the `libopts' source tarball.  This source may be
incorporated into your package with the following simple commands:

    rm -rf libopts libopts-*
    gunzip -c `autoopts-config libsrc` | \
       tar -xvf -
    mv libopts-*.*.* libopts

   View the `libopts/README' file for further integration information.

7.3 Developer and User Notes
============================

AutoOpts has its conventional way of displaying option information that
includes somewhat more information that the standard GNU method.
AutoOpts will also print out a line of usage text for each option type
when options are misspecified.  GNU programs typically do not do this.
These defaults can be changed on a per-program basis by adding either
or both of the following in the option definition file:

    gnu-usage;
    no-misuse-usage;

   Users may also override these settings with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE'
environment variable.  It may be set to a comma or white space separated
list of the following strings:

`gnu'
     The format of the extended usage text will be displayed in
     GNU-normal form.  The default display for `--version' will be to
     include a note on licensing terms.

`autoopts'
     The format of the extended usage will be in AutoOpts' native
     layout.

`no-misuse-usage'
     When an option error is made on the command line, the abbreviated
     usage text will be suppressed.

`misuse-usage'
     When an option error is made on the command line, the abbreviated
     usage text will be shown.

The setting used is the last one seen.  The `autoopts' and
`misuse-usage' serve no purpose, unless the definition file entries
were specified as above.

   Note for developers:

   The templates used to implement AutoOpts depend heavily upon token
pasting.  That mens that if you name an option, "debug", for example,
the generated header will expect to be able to emit `#define' macros
such as this:
    #define DESC(n) (autogenOptions.pOptDesc[INDEX_OPT_## n])
   and expect `DESC(DEBUG)' to expand correctly into
`(autogenOptions.pOptDesc[INDEX_OPT_DEBUG])'.  If `DEBUG' is `#defined'
to something else, then that something else will be in the above
expansion.

   If you discover you are having strange problems like this, you may
wish to use some variation of the `guard-option-names' *Note program
attributes::.


File: autogen.info,  Node: Quick Start,  Next: Option Definitions,  Prev: Caveats,  Up: AutoOpts

7.4 Quick Start
===============

Since it is generally easier to start with a simple example than it is
to look at the options that AutoGen uses itself, here is a very simple
AutoOpts example.  You can copy this example out of the Info file and
into a source file to try it.  You can then embellish it into what you
really need.  For more extensive examples, you can also examine the help
output and option definitions for the commands `columns', `getdefs' and
`autogen' itself.

   For our simple example, assume you have a program named `check' that
takes two options:

  1. A list of directories to check over for whatever it is `check'
     does.  You want this option available as a POSIX-style flag option
     and a GNU long option.  You want to allow as many of these as the
     user wishes.

  2. An option to show or not show the definition tree being used.
     Only one occurrence is to be allowed, specifying one or the other.

First, specify your program attributes and its options to AutoOpts, as
with the following example.

    AutoGen Definitions options;
    prog-name     = check;
    prog-title    = "Checkout Automated Options";
    long-opts;
    gnu-usage;    /* GNU style preferred to default */

    main = { main-type = shell-process; };

    flag = {
        name      = check-dirs;
        value     = L;        /* flag style option character */
        arg-type  = string;   /* option argument indication  */
        max       = NOLIMIT;  /* occurrence limit (none)     */
        stack-arg;            /* save opt args in a stack    */
        descrip   = "Checkout directory list";
        doc       = 'name of each directory that is to be "checked out".';
    };

    flag = {
        name      = show_defs;
        descrip   = "Show the definition tree";
        disable   = dont;     /* mark as enable/disable type */
                              /* option.  Disable as `dont-' */
        doc       = 'disable, if you do not want to see the tree.';
    };

This program will produce a program that digests its options and writes
the values as shell script code to stdout.  Run the following short
script to produce this program:

    base=check
    BASE=`echo $base | tr a-z- A-Z_`
    cflags="-DTEST_${BASE} `autoopts-config cflags`"
    ldflags="`autoopts-config ldflags`"
    autogen ${base}.def
    cc -o ${base} -g ${cflags} ${base}.c ${ldflags}
    ./${base} --help

Running those commands yields:

    check - Checkout Automated Options
    USAGE:  check [ -<flag> [<val>] | --<name>[{=| }<val>] ]...

       -L, --check-dirs=str       Checkout directory list
                                    - may appear multiple times
           --show-defs            Show the definition tree
                                    - disabled as --dont-show-defs
       -?, --help                 Display extended usage information and exit
       -!, --more-help            Extended usage information passed thru pager

    Options are specified by doubled hyphens and their name or by a single
    hyphen and the flag character.
    Packaged by Bruce (2012-02-26)
    Report check bugs to bkorb@gnu.org

Normally, however, you would not use the "main" clause.  Instead, the
file would be named something like `checkopt.def', you would compile
`checkopt.c' the usual way, and link the object with the rest of your
program.

   The options are processed by calling `optionProcess' (*note
libopts-optionProcess::):

    main( int argc, char** argv )
    {
      {
        int optct = optionProcess( &checkOptions, argc, argv );
        argc -= optct;
        argv += optct;
      }

   The options are tested and used as in the following fragment.
"`ENABLED_OPT'" is used instead of "`HAVE_OPT'" for the `show-defs'
option because it is an enabled/disabled option type:

      if (  ENABLED_OPT( SHOW_DEFS )
         && HAVE_OPT( CHECK_DIRS )) {
        int    dirct = STACKCT_OPT( CHECK_DIRS );
        char** dirs  = STACKLST_OPT( CHECK_DIRS );
        while (dirct-- > 0) {
          char* dir = *dirs++;
          ...

   The "doc" clauses are used in the flag stanzas for man pages and
texinfo invoking documentation.  With the above definition file, the
two following commands will produce the two documentation files
`check.1' and `invoke-check.texi'.  The latter file will be generated
as a chapter, rather than a section or subsection.

    autogen -Tagman-cmd check.def
    autogen -DLEVEL=chapter -Tagtexi-cmd -binvoke-check.texi check.def

The result of which is left as an exercise for the reader.

   A lot of magic happens to make this happen.  The rest of this
chapter will describe the myriad of option attributes supported by
AutoOpts.  However, keep in mind that, in general, you won't need much
more than what was described in this "quick start" section.


File: autogen.info,  Node: Option Definitions,  Next: AutoOpts API,  Prev: Quick Start,  Up: AutoOpts

7.5 Option Definitions
======================

AutoOpts uses an AutoGen definitions file for the definitions of the
program options and overall configuration attributes.  The complete
list of program and option attributes is quite extensive, so if you are
reading to understand how to use AutoOpts, I recommend reading the
"Quick Start" section (*note Quick Start::) and paying attention to the
following:

  1. `prog-name', `prog-title', and `argument', program attributes,
     *Note program attributes::.

  2. `name' and `descrip' option attributes, *Note Required
     Attributes::.

  3. `value' (flag character) and `min' (occurrence counts) option
     attributes, *Note Common Attributes::.

  4. `arg-type' from the option argument specification section, *Note
     Option Arguments::.

  5. Read the overall how to, *Note Using AutoOpts::.

  6. Highly recommended, but not required, are the several "man" and
     "info" documentation attributes, *Note documentation attributes::.

   Keep in mind that the majority are rarely used and can be safely
ignored.  However, when you have special option processing requirements,
the flexibility is there.

7.5.1 Program Description Attributes
------------------------------------

The following global definitions are used to define attributes of the
entire program.  These generally alter the configuration or global
behavior of the AutoOpts option parser.  The first two are required of
every program.  The third is required if there are to be any left over
arguments (operands) after option processing.  The rest have been
grouped below.  Except as noted, there may be only one copy of each of
these definitions:

`prog-name'
     This attribute is required.  Variable names derived from this name
     are derived using `string->c_name!' (*note SCM string->c-name!::).

`prog-title'
     This attribute is required and may be any descriptive text.

`argument'
     This attribute is required if your program uses operand arguments.
     It specifies the syntax of the arguments that *follow* the options.
     It may not be empty, but if it is not supplied, then option
     processing must consume all the arguments.  If it is supplied and
     starts with an open bracket (`['), then there is no requirement on
     the presence or absence of command line arguments following the
     options.  Lastly, if it is supplied and does not start with an
     open bracket, then option processing must *not* consume all of the
     command line arguments.

File: autogen.info,  Node: usage attributes,  Next: config attributes,  Up: program attributes

7.5.1.1 Usage and Version Info Display
......................................

These will affect the way usage is seen and whether or not version
information gets displayed.

`full-usage'
     If this attribute is provided, it may specify the full length
     usage text, or a variable name assignable to a "char const *"
     pointer, or it may be empty.  The meanings are determined by  the
     length.
        * If not provided, the text will be computed as normal.

        * If the length is zero, then the usage text will be derived
          from the current settings and inserted as text into the
          generated .c file.

        * If the length is 1 to 32 bytes, then it is presumed to be a
          variable name that either points to or is an array of const
          chars.

        * If it is longer than that, it is presumed to be the help text
          itself.  This text will be inserted into the generated .c
          file.

     This string should be readily translatable and provision will be
     made to translate it if this is provided and the source code is
     compiled with "ENABLE_NLS" defined.

`short-usage'
     If this attribute is provided, it is used to specify an abbreviated
     version of the usage text.  This text is constructed in the same
     way as the "full-usage", described above.

`gnu-usage'
     AutoOpts normaly displays usage text in a format that provides more
     information than the standard GNU layout, but that also means it is
     not the standard GNU layout.  This attribute changes the default to
     GNU layout, with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment variable used to
     request `autoopts' layout.  See *Note Developer and User Notes:
     Caveats.

`no-misuse-usage'
     When there is a command line syntax error, by default AutoOpts will
     display the abbreviated usage text, rather than just a one line
     "you goofed it, ask for usage" message.  You can change the default
     behavior for your program by supplying this attribute.  The user
     may override this choice, again, with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE'
     environment variable.  See *Note Developer and User Notes: Caveats.

`prog-group'
     The version text in the `getopt.tpl' template will include this
     text in parentheses after the program name, when this attribute is
     specified.  For example:
         mumble (stumble) 1.0
     says that the "`mumble'" program is version 1.0 and is part of the
     "`stumble'" group of programs.

`version'
     Specifies the program version and activates the VERSION option,
     *Note automatic options::.

7.5.1.2 Program Configuration
.............................

Programs may be "pre-configured" before normal command line options are
processed (See *note Immediate Action Attributes: Immediate Action.).
How configuration files and environment variables are handled get
specified with these attributes.

`disable-load'
`disable-save'
     Indicates that the command line usage of `--load-opts' and/or
     `--save-opts' are disallowed.

`environrc'
     Indicates looking in the environment for values of variables named,
     `PROGRAM_OPTNAME' or `PROGRAM', where `PROGRAM' is the upper cased
     `C-name' of the program and `OPTNAME' is the upper cased `C-name'
     of a specific option.  The contents of the `PROGRAM' variable, if
     found, are tokenized and processed.  The contents of
     `PROGRAM_OPTNAME' environment variables are taken as the option
     argument to the option nameed `optname'.

`homerc'
     Specifies that option settings may be loaded from and stored into
     configuration files.  Each instance of this attribute is either a
     directory or a file using a specific path, a path based on an
     environment variable or a path relative to installation
     directories.  The method used depends on the name.  If the one
     entry is empty, it enables the loading and storing of settings,
     but no specific files are searched for.  Otherwise, a series of
     configuration files are hunted down and, if found, loaded.

     If the first character of the `homerc' value is not the dollar
     character (`$'), then it is presumed to be a path name based on the
     current directory.  Otherwise, the method depends on the second
     character:

    `$'
          The path is relative to the directory where the executable
          was found.

    `@'
          The path is relative to the package data directory, e.g.
          `/usr/local/share/autogen'.

    `[a-zA-Z]'
          The path is derived from the named environment variable.

     Use as many as you like.  The presence of this attribute activates
     the `--save-opts' and `--load-opts' options.  However, saving into
     a file may be disabled with the `disable-save'.  *Note loading
     rcfile::.  See the `optionMakePath(3AGEN)' man page for
     excruciating details.

`rcfile'
     Specifies the configuration file name.  This is only useful if you
     have provided at least one `homerc' attribute.
         default: .<prog-name>rc

`vendor-opt'
     This option implements the `-W' vendor option command line option.

     For POSIX specified utilities, the options are constrained to the
     options that are specified by POSIX.  Extensions should be handled
     with `-W' command line options, the short flag form.  Long option
     name processing must be disabled.  In fact, the `long-opts'
     attribute must not be provided, and some options must be specified
     without flag values.

     The `-W long-name' is processed by looking up the long option name
     that follows it.  It cannot be a short flag because that would
     conflict with the POSIX flag name space.  It will be processed as
     if long options were accepted and `--long-name' were found on the
     command line.

7.5.1.3 Programming Details
...........................

These attributes affect some of the ways that the option data are used
and made available to the program.

`config-header'
     The contents of this attribute should be just the name of the
     configuration file.  A "#include" naming this file will be
     inserted at the top of the generated header.

`exit-name'
`exit-desc'
     These values should be defined as indexed values, thus:
         exit-name[0] = success;
         exit-desc[0] = 'Successful program execution.';
         exit-name[1] = failure;
         exit-desc[1] = 'The operation failed or command syntax was not valid.';
     By default, all programs have these effectively defined for them.
     They may be overridden by explicitly defining any or all of these
     values.  Additional names and descriptions may be defined.  They
     will cause an enumeration to be emitted, like this one for
     `getdefs':
         typedef enum {
             GETDEFS_EXIT_SUCCESS = 0,
             GETDEFS_EXIT_FAILURE = 1
         } getdefs_exit_code_t;
     which will be augmented by any `exit-name' definitions beyond "1".

`usage-message'
     This attribute will cause two procedures to be added to the code
     file: `usage_message' and `vusage_message', with any applicable
     prefix (see `prefix', below).  They are declared in the generated
     header, thus:
         extern void vusage_message(char const * fmt, va_list ap);
         extern void usage_message(char const * fmt, ...);
     These functions print the message to `stderr' and invoke the usage
     function with the exit code set to `1' (`EXIT_FAILURE').

`export'
     This string is inserted into the .h interface file.  Generally
     used for global variables or `#include' directives required by
     `flag-code' text and shared with other program text.  Do not
     specify your configuration header (`config.h') in this attribute
     or the `include' attribute, however.  Instead, use
     `config-header', above.

`guard-option-names'
     AutoOpts generates macros that presume that there are no `cpp'
     macros with the same name as the option name.  For example, if you
     have an option named, `debug', then you must not use `#ifdef
     DEBUG' in your code.  If you specify this attribute, every option
     name will be guarded.  If the name is `#define'-d, then a warning
     will be issued and the name undefined.  If you do not specify this
     and there is a conflict, you will get strange error messages.

     This attribute may be set to any of four recognized states:

        * Not defined.  AutoOpts will behave as described above.

        * Defined, but set to the empty string.  Text will be emitted
          into the header to undefine (`#undef') any conflicting
          preprocessor macros.  The code will include compiler warnings
          (via `#warning').  Some compilers are not ANSI-C-99 compliant
          yet and will error out on those warnings.  You may compile
          with `-DNO_OPTION_NAME_WARNINGS' to silence or mostly silence
          them.

        * Defined and set to the string, "`no-warning'".  All of the
          needed `#undef's will be emitted, without any conflict
          checking `#warning' directives emitted.

        * Defined and set to the string, "`full-enum'".  The option
          manipulation preprocessor macros will not token paste the
          option names to the index enumeration prefix.  e.g. you will
          need to use `HAVE_OPT(INDEX_OPT_DEBUG)' instead of
          `HAVE_OPT(DEBUG)'.

`include'
     This string is inserted into the .c file.  Generally used for
     global variables required only by `flag-code' program text.

`no-libopts'
     If you are going to handle your option processing with the
     `getopt.tpl' template instead of using libopts, then specify this
     attribute.  It will suppress mention of `--more-help' in the
     generated documentation.  (`getopt_long' does not support
     `--more-help'.)

`prefix'
     This value is inserted into *all* global names.  This will
     disambiguate them if more than one set of options are to be
     compiled into a single program.


File: autogen.info,  Node: presentation attributes,  Prev: programming attributes,  Up: program attributes

7.5.1.4 User Presentation Attributes
....................................

Attributes that affect the user's experience.

`allow-errors'
     The presence of this attribute indicates ignoring any command line
     option errors.  This may also be turned on and off by invoking the
     macros `ERRSKIP_OPTERR' and `ERRSTOP_OPTERR' from the generated
     interface file.

`long-opts'
     Presence indicates GNU-standard long option processing.  Partial
     name matches are accepted, if they are at least two characters
     long and the partial match is unique.  The matching is not case
     sensitive, and the underscore, hyphen and carat characters are all
     equivalent (they match).

     If any options do not have an option value (flag character)
     specified, and least one does specify such a value, then you must
     specify `long-opts'.  If none of your options specify an option
     value (flag character) and you do not specify `long-opts', then
     command line arguments are processed in "named option mode".  This
     means that:

        * Every command line argument must be a long option.

        * The flag markers `-' and `--' are completely optional.

        * The `argument' program attribute is disallowed.

        * One of the options may be specified as the default (as long
          as it has a required option argument).

`no-xlate'
     Modifies when or whether option names get translated.  If provided,
     it must be assigned one of two values:
    `opt-cfg'
          to suppress option name translation for configuration file
          and and environment variable processing.

    `opt'
          to suppress option name translation completely.  The usage
          text will always be translated if `ENABLE_NLS' is defined and
          you have translations for that text.
     See also the various "`XLAT'" interface entries in the AutoOpts
     Programmatic Interface section (*note AutoOpts API::).

`reorder-args'
     Normally, POSIX compliant commands do not allow for options to be
     interleaved with operands.  If this is necessary for historical
     reasons, there are two approaches available:
        * Allow `optionProcess' to return the index of the operand like
          it normally does and process the operand(s).  When an operand
          is encountered that starts with a hyphen, then set the
          AutoOpts current index with the `RESTART_OPT' macro (see
          *note RESTART_OPT::), and re-invoke `optionProcess'.  This
          will also allow you to process the operands in context.

        * Specify this attribute.  AutoOpts will re-order the command
          arguments so that the operands appear (in the original order)
          at the end of the argument list.  Differing configuration
          state is not possible to detect after all options have been
          processed.

`resettable'
     Specifies that the `--reset-option' command line option is to be
     supported.  This makes it possible to suppress any setting that
     might be found in a configuration file or environment variable.

7.5.2 Options for Library Code
------------------------------

Some libraries provide their own code for processing command line
options, and this may be used by programs that utilize AutoOpts.  You
may also wish to write a library that gets configured with AutoOpts
options and config files.  Such a library may either supply its own
configury routine and process its own options, or it may export its
option descriptions to programs that also use AutoOpts.  This section
will describe how to do all of these different things.

* Menu:

* lib and program::         AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed Program
* lib called::              AutoOpt-ed Library for Regular Program
* prog calls lib::          AutoOpt-ed Program Calls Regular Library


File: autogen.info,  Node: lib and program,  Next: lib called,  Up: library attributes

7.5.2.1 AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed Program
.................................................

The library source code must provide an option definition file that
consists of only the attribute `library' and `flag' entries.  The
"library" attribute does not need any associated value, so it will
generally appeary by itself on a line folowed by a semi-colon.  The
first `flag' entry must contain the following attributes:

`name'
     This name is used in the construction of a global pointer of type
     `tOptDesc const*'.  It is always required.

`documentation'
     It tells `AutoOpts' that this option serves no normal purpose.  It
     will be used to add usage clarity and to locate option descriptors
     in the library code.

`descrip'
     This is a string that is inserted in the extended usage display
     before the options specific to the current library.  It is always
     required.

`lib-name'
     This should match the name of the library.  This string is also
     used in the construction of the option descriptor pointer name.
     In the end, it looks like this:
         extern tOptDesc const* <<lib-name>>_<<name>>_optDesc_p;
     and is used in the macros generated for the library's `.h' file.

   In order to compile this `AutoOpts' using library, you must create a
special header that is not used by the client program.  This is
accomplished by creating an option definition file that contains
essentially exactly the following:

    AutoGen definitions options;
    prog-name  = does-not-matter;  // but is always required
    prog-title = 'also does not matter';  // also required
    config-header = 'config.h'; // optional, but common
    library;
    #include library-options-only.def

and nothing else.  AutoGen will produce only the `.h' file.  You may
now compile your library, referencing just this `.h' file.  The macros
it creates will utilize a global variable that will be defined by the
`AutoOpts'-using client program.  That program will need to have the
following `#include' in its option definition file:

    #include library-options-only.def

All the right things will magically happen so that the global variables
named `<<lib-name>>_<<name>>_optDesc_p' are initialized correctly.  For
an example, please see the `AutoOpts' test script:
`autoopts/test/library.test'.

7.5.2.2 AutoOpt-ed Library for Regular Program
..............................................

In this case, your library must provide an option processing function
to a calling program.  This is accomplished by setting the
`allow-errors' global option attribute.  Each time your option handling
function is called, you must determine where your scan is to resume and
tell the AutoOpts library by invoking:

    RESTART_OPT(next_arg_index);

and then invoke `not_opt_index = optionProcess(...)'.  The
`not_opt_index' value can be used to set `optind', if that is the
global being used to scan the program argument array.

   In this method, do *NOT* utilize the global `library' attribute.
Your library must specify its options as if it were a complete program.
You may choose to specify an alternate `usage()' function so that usage
for other parts of the option interface may be displayed as well.  See
"Program Information Attributes" (*note information attributes::).

   At the moment, there is no method for calling `optionUsage()' telling
it to produce just the information about the options and not the program
as a whole.  Some later revision after somebody asks.

7.5.2.3 AutoOpt-ed Program Calls Regular Library
................................................

As with providing an `AutoOpt'-ed library to a non-`AutoOpt'-ed
program, you must write the option description file as if you were
writing all the options for the program, but you should specify the
`allow-errors' global option attribute and you will likely want an
alternate `usage()' function (see "Program Information Attributes"
*note information attributes::).  In this case, though, when
`optionProcess()' returns, you need to test to see if there might be
library options.  If there might be, then call the library's exported
routine for handling command line options, set the
next-option-to-process with the `RESTART_OPT()' macro, and recall
`optionProcess()'.  Repeat until done.


File: autogen.info,  Node: information attributes,  Next: Generated main,  Prev: library attributes,  Up: Option Definitions

7.5.3 Program Information Attributes
------------------------------------

These attributes are used to define how and what information is
displayed to the user of the program.

`copyright'
     The `copyright' is a structured value containing three to five
     values.  If `copyright' is used, then the first three are required.

       1. `date' - the list of applicable dates for the copyright.

       2. `owner' - the name of the copyright holder.

       3. `type' - specifies the type of distribution license.
          AutoOpts/AutoGen supports the text of the GNU Public License
          (`gpl'), the GNU "Lesser" General Public License with Library
          extensions (`lgpl'), the Modified Free BSD license (`mbsd')
          and a few others.  Other licenses may be specified, but you
          must provide your own license file.  The list of license
          files provided by AutoOpts may be seen by typing:
              ls $(autoopts-config pkgdatadir)/*.lic

       4. `text' - the text of the copyright notice.  This must be
          provided if `type' is set to `NOTE'.

       5. `author' - in case the author name is to appear in the
          documentation and is different from the copyright owner.

       6. `eaddr' - email address for receiving praises and complaints.
          Typically that of the author or copyright holder.

     An example of this might be:
         copyright = {
             date  = "1992-2012";
             owner = "Bruce Korb";
             eaddr = 'bkorb@gnu.org';
             type  = GPL;
         };

`detail'
     This string is added to the usage output when the HELP option is
     selected.

`explain'
     Gives additional information whenever the usage routine is invoked.

`package'
     The name of the package the program belongs to.  This will appear
     parenthetically after the program name in the version and usage
     output, e.g.:  `autogen (GNU autogen) - The Automated Program
     Generator'.

`preserve-case'
     This attribute will not change anything except appearance.
     Normally, the option names are all documented in lower case.
     However, if you specify this attribute, then they will display in
     the case used in their specification.  Command line options will
     still be matched without case sensitivity.  This is useful for
     specifying option names in camel-case.

`prog-desc *and*'
`opts-ptr'
     These define global pointer variables that point to the program
     descriptor and the first option descriptor for a library option.
     This is intended for use by certain libraries that need command
     line and/or initialization file option processing.  These
     definitions have no effect on the option template output, but are
     used for creating a library interface file.  Normally, the first
     "option" for a library will be a documentation option that cannot
     be specified on the command line, but is marked as `settable'.
     The library client program will invoke the `SET_OPTION' macro
     which will invoke a handler function that will finally set these
     global variables.

`usage'
     Optionally names the usage procedure, if the library routine
     `optionUsage()' does not work for you.  If you specify `my_usage'
     as the value of this attribute, for example, you will use a
     procedure by that name for displaying usage.  Of course, you will
     need to provide that procedure and it must conform to this profile:
         void my_usage( tOptions* pOptions, int exitCode )

`gnu-usage'
     Normally, the default format produced by the `optionUsage'
     procedure is AutoOpts Standard.  By specifying this attribute, the
     default format will be GNU-ish style.  Either default may be
     overridden by the user with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment
     variable.  If it is set to `gnu' or `autoopts', it will alter the
     style appropriately.  This attribute will conflict with the
     `usage' attribute.

`reorder-args'
     Some applications traditionally require that the command operands
     be intermixed with the command options.  In order to handle that,
     the arguments must be reordered.  If you are writing such an
     application, specify this global option.  All of the options (and
     any associated option arguments) will be brought to the beginning
     of the argument list.  New applications should not use this
     feature, if at all possible.  This feature is disabled if
     `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is defined in the environment.

7.5.4 Generating main procedures
--------------------------------

When AutoOpts generates the code to parse the command line options, it
has the ability to produce any of several types of `main()' procedures.
This is done by specifying a global structured value for `main'.  The
values that it contains are dependent on the value set for the one
value it must have: `main-type'.

   The recognized values for `main-type' are:

* Menu:

* main guile::              guile: main and inner_main procedures
* main shell-process::      shell-process: emit Bourne shell results
* main shell-parser::       shell-parser: emit Bourne shell script
* main main::               main: user supplied main procedure
* main include::            include: code emitted from included template
* main invoke::             invoke: code emitted from AutoGen macro
* main for-each::           for-each: perform function on each argument

   Here is an example of an `include' variation:

    main = {
      main-type = include;
      tpl       = "main-template.tpl";
    };


File: autogen.info,  Node: main guile,  Next: main shell-process,  Up: Generated main

7.5.4.1 guile: main and inner_main procedures
.............................................

When the `main-type' is specified to be `guile', a `main()' procedure
is generated that calls `gh_enter()', providing it with a generated
`inner_main()' to invoke.  If you must perform certain tasks before
calling `gh_enter()', you may specify such code in the value for the `before-guile-boot'
attribute.

   The `inner_main()' procedure itself will process the command line
arguments (by calling `optionProcess()', *note
libopts-optionProcess::), and then either invoke the code specified
with the `guile-main' attribute, or else export the parsed options to
Guile symbols and invoke the `scm_shell()' function from the Guile
library.  This latter will render the program nearly identical to the
stock `guile(1)' program.


File: autogen.info,  Node: main shell-process,  Next: main shell-parser,  Prev: main guile,  Up: Generated main

7.5.4.2 shell-process: emit Bourne shell results
................................................

This will produce a `main()' procedure that parses the command line
options and emits to `stdout' Bourne shell commands that puts the
option state into environment variables.  This can be used within a
shell script as follows:

    unset OPTION_CT
    eval "`opt_parser \"$@\"`"
    test -z "${OPTION_CT}" && exit 1
    test ${OPTION_CT} -gt 0 && shift ${OPTION_CT}

   If the option parsing code detects an error or a request for usage,
it will not emit an assignment to OPTION_CT and the script should just
exit.  If the options are set consistently, then something along the
lines of the following will be written to `stdout' and evaled:

        OPTION_CT=4
        export OPTION_CT
        MYPROG_SECOND='first'
        export MYPROG_SECOND
        MYPROG_ANOTHER=1 # 0x1
        export MYPROG_ANOTHER

If the arguments are to be reordered, however, then the resulting set
of operands will be emitted and `OPTION_CT' gets set to zero.  For
example, the following would be appended to the above:

        set -- 'operand1' 'operand2' 'operand3'
        OPTION_CT=0

`OPTION_CT' is set to zero since it is not necessary to shift off any
options.


File: autogen.info,  Node: main shell-parser,  Next: main main,  Prev: main shell-process,  Up: Generated main

7.5.4.3 shell-parser: emit Bourne shell script
..............................................

This will produce a `main()' procedure that emits a shell script that
will parse the command line options.  That script can be emitted to
`stdout' or inserted or substituted into a pre-existing shell script
file.  Improbable markers are used to identify previously inserted
parsing text:

    # # # # # # # # # # -- do not modify this marker --

The program is also pretty insistent upon starting its parsing script
on the second line.

7.5.4.4 main: user supplied main procedure
..........................................

You must supply a value for the `main-text' attribute.  You may also
supply a value for `option-code'.  If you do, then the `optionProcess'
invocation will not be emitted into the code.  AutoOpts will wrap the
`main-text' inside of:

    int
    main( int argc, char** argv )
    {
        { // replaced by option-code, if that exists
            int ct = optionProcess( &<<prog-name>>Options, argc, argv );
            argc -= ct;
            argv += ct;
        }
    <<your main-text goes here>>
    }

so you can most conveniently set the value with a "`here string'"
(*note here-string::):

    code = <<- _EndOfMainProc_
    	<<your text goes here>>
    	_EndOfMainProc_;

7.5.4.5 include: code emitted from included template
....................................................

You must write a template to produce your main procedure.  You specify
the name of the template with the `tpl' attribute and it will be
incorporated at the point where AutoOpts is ready to emit the `main()'
procedure.

   This can be very useful if, in your working environment, you have
many programs with highly similar `main()' procedures.  All you need to
do is parameterize the variations and specify which variant is needed
within the `main' AutoOpts specification.  Since you are coding the
template for this, the attributes needed for this variation would be
dictated by your template.

7.5.4.6 invoke: code emitted from AutoGen macro
...............................................

You must write a template to produce your main procedure.  That template
must contain a definition for the function specified with the `func'
attribute to this `main()' procedure specification.  Typically, this
template will be incorporated by using the `--lib-template' option
(*note autogen lib-template::) in the AutoGen invocation.  Otherwise,
this variation operates in much the same way as "`include'" (*note main
include::) method.


File: autogen.info,  Node: main for-each,  Prev: main invoke,  Up: Generated main

7.5.4.7 for-each: perform function on each argument
...................................................

This produces a main procedure that invokes a procedure once for each
operand on the command line (non-option arguments), *OR* once for each
non-blank, non-comment `stdin' input line.  Leading and trailing white
space is trimmed from the input line and comment lines are lines that
are empty or begin with a comment character, defaulting to a hash ('#')
character.

   *NB*: The `argument' program attribute (*note program attributes::)
must begin with the `[' character, to indicate that there are command
operands, but that they are optional.

   There are a number of attributes to `main' that may be used:

`handler-proc'
     This attribute is required.  It is used to name the procedure to
     call.  That procedure is presumed to be external, but if you
     provide the code for it, then the procedure is emitted as a static
     procedure in the generated code.

     This procedure should return 0 on success, a cumulative error code
     on warning and exit without returning on an unrecoverable error.
     As the cumulative warning codes are or-ed together, the codes
     should be some sort of bit mask in order to be ultimately
     decipherable (if you need to do that).

     If the called procedure needs to cause a fail-exit, it is expected
     to call `exit(3)' directly.  If you want to cause a warning exit
     code, then this handler function should return a non-zero status.
     That value will be *OR*-ed into a result integer for computing the
     final exit code.  E.g., here is part of the emitted code:

           int res = 0;
           if (argc > 0) {
              do  {
                  res |= my_handler( *(argv++) );
              } while (--argc > 0);
           } else { ...

`handler-type'
     If you do not supply this attribute, your handler procedure must be
     the default type.  The profile of the procedure must be:

         int my_handler( char const *pz_entry );

     However, if you do supply this attribute, you may set the value to
     any of four alternate flavors:

    `name-of-file'
          This is essentially the same as the default handler type,
          except that before your procedure is invoked, the generated
          code has verified that the string names an existing file.
          The profile is unchanged.

    `file-X'
          Before calling your procedure, the file is f-opened according
          to the "X", where "X" may be any of the legal modes for
          `fopen(3C)'.  In this case, the profile for your procedure
          must be:

              int my_handler( char const* pz_fname, FILE* entry_fp );

    `text-of-file'
    `some-text-of-file'
          Before calling your procedure, the contents of the file are
          read or mapped into memory.  (Excessively large files may
          cause problems.)  The `some-text-of-file' disallows empty
          files.  Both require regular files.  In this case, the profile
          for your procedure must be:

              program_exit_code_t
              my_handler(char const* pz_fname, char* file_text,
                         size_t text_size);

          Note that though the `file_text' is not `const', any changes
          made to it are not written back to the original file.  It is
          merely a memory image of the file contents.  Also, the memory
          allocated to hold the text is `text_size + 1' bytes long and
          the final byte is always `NUL'.  The file contents need not
          be text, as the data are read with the `read(2)' system call.

     If you select one of these file type handlers, then on access or
     usage errors the `PROGRAM_EXIT_FAILURE' exit code will, by
     default, be or-ed into the final exit code.  This can be changed
     by specifying the global `file-fail-code' attribute and naming a
     different value.  That is, something other than `failure'.  You
     may choose `success', in which case file access issues will not
     affect the exit code and the error message will not be printed.

`my_handler-code'
     With this attribute, you provide the code for your handler
     procedure in the option definition file.  In this case, your
     `main()' procedure specification might look something like this:

         main = {
           main-type    = for-each;
           handler-proc = my_handler;
           my_handler-code = <<- EndOfMyCode
         	/* whatever you want to do */
         	EndOfMyCode;
         };

     and instead of an emitted external reference, a procedure will be
     emitted that looks like this:

         static int
         my_handler( char const* pz_entry )
         {
             int res = 0;
             <<my_handler-code goes here>>
             return res;
         }

`main-init'
     This is code that gets inserted after the options have been
     processed, but before the handler procs get invoked.

`main-fini'
     This is code that gets inserted after all the entries have been
     processed, just before returning from `main()'.

`comment-char'
     If you wish comment lines to start with a character other than a
     hash (`#') character, then specify one character with this
     attribute.  If that character is the `NUL' byte, then only blank
     lines will be considered comments.

7.5.5 Option Attributes
-----------------------

For each option you wish to specify, you must have a block macro named
`flag' defined.  There are two required attributes: `name' and
`descrip'.  If any options do not have a `value' (traditional flag
character) attribute, then the `long-opts' program attribute must also
be defined.  As a special exception, if no options have a `value' *and*
`long-opts' is not defined *and* `argument' is not defined, then all
arguments to the program are named options.  In this case, the `-' and
`--' command line option markers are optional.

File: autogen.info,  Node: Required Attributes,  Next: Common Attributes,  Up: option attributes

7.5.5.1 Required Attributes
...........................

Every option must have exactly one copy of both of these attributes.

`name'
     Long name for the option.  Even if you are not accepting long
     options and are only accepting flags, it must be provided.
     AutoOpts generates private, named storage that requires this name.
     This name also causes a `#define'-d name to be emitted.  It must
     not conflict with any other names you may be using in your program.

     For example, if your option name is, `debug' or `munged-up', you
     must not use the `#define' names `DEBUG' (or `MUNGED_UP') in your
     program for non-AutoOpts related purposes.  They are now used by
     AutoOpts.

     Sometimes (most especially under Windows), you may get a surprise.
     For example, `INTERFACE' is apparently a user space name that one
     should be free to use.  Windows usurps this name.  To solve this,
     you must do one of the following:

       1. Change the name of your option

       2. add the program attribute (*note program attributes::):

              export = '#undef INTERFACE';

       3. add the program attribute:

              guard-option-names;

`descrip'
     Except for documentation options, a *very* brief description of the
     option.  About 40 characters on one line, maximum, not counting
     any texinfo markups.  Texinfo markups are stripped before printing
     in the usage text.  It appears on the `usage()' output next to the
     option name.

     If, however, the option is a documentation option, it will appear
     on one or more lines by itself.  It is thus used to visually
     separate and comment upon groups of options in the usage text.


File: autogen.info,  Node: Common Attributes,  Next: Immediate Action,  Prev: Required Attributes,  Up: option attributes

7.5.5.2 Common Option Attributes
................................

These option attributes are optional.  Any that do appear in the
definition of a flag, may appear only once.

`value'
     The flag character to specify for traditional option flags, e.g.,
     `-L'.

`max'
     Maximum occurrence count (invalid if DISABLE present).  The
     default maximum is 1.  `NOLIMIT' can be used for the value,
     otherwise it must be a number or a `#define' that evaluates to a
     number.

`min'
     Minimum occurrence count.  If present, then the option *must*
     appear on the command line.  Do not define it with the value zero
     (0).

`must-set'
     If an option must be specified, but it need not be specified on
     the command line, then specify this attribute for the option.

`deprecated'
     There are two effects to this attribute:  the usage text will not
     show the option, and the generated documentation will mark it with:
     "_NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED_".

`disable'
     Prefix for disabling (inverting sense of) the option.  Only useful
     if long option names are being processed.  When an option has this
     attribute, the test `ENABLED_OPT(OPTNAME)' is false when either of
     the following is true:
        * The option has not been specified and the `enable' attribute
          has not been specified.

        * The option has been specified with this disabling prefix.
     To detect that the option has been specified with the disabling
     prefix, you must use:
         HAVE_OPT(OPTNAME) && ! ENABLED_OPT(OPTNAME)

`enable'
     Long-name prefix for enabling the option (invalid if DISABLE *not*
     present).  Only useful if long option names are being processed.

`enabled'
     If default is for option being enabled.  (Otherwise, the
     OPTST_DISABLED bit is set at compile time.)  Only useful if the
     option can be disabled.

`ifdef'
`ifndef'
`omitted-usage'
     If an option is relevant on certain platforms or when certain
     features are enabled or disabled, you can specify the compile time
     flag used to indicate when the option should be compiled in or
     out.  For example, if you have a configurable feature, `mumble'
     that is indicated with the compile time define, `WITH_MUMBLING',
     then add:

         ifdef = WITH_MUMBLING;

     Take care when using these.  There are several caveats:

        * The case and spelling must match whatever is specified.

        * Do not confuse these attributes with the AutoGen directives
          of the same names, *Note Directives::.  These cause C
          preprocessing directives to be inserted into the generated C
          text.

        * Only one of `ifdef' and `ifndef' may apply to any one option.

        * The `VALUE_OPT_' values are `#define'-d.  If `WITH_MUMBLING'
          is not defined, then the associated `VALUE_OPT_' value will
          not be `#define'-d either.  So, if you have an option named,
          `MUMBLING' that is active only if `WITH_MUMBLING' is
          `#define'-d, then `VALUE_OPT_MUMBLING' will be `#define'-d
          iff `WITH_MUMBLING' is `#define'-d.  Watch those switch
          statements.

        * If you specify `omitted-usage', then the option will be
          recognized as disabled when it is configured out of the
          build, but will yield the message, "This option has been
          disabled."  You may specify an alternate message by giving
          `omitted-usage' a string value. e.g.:
              omitted-usage = 'you cannot do this';

`no-command'
     This option specifies that the option is not allowed on the
     command line.  Such an option may not take a `value' (flag
     character) attribute.  The program must have the `homerc' (*note
     program attributes::) option set.


File: autogen.info,  Node: Immediate Action,  Next: Option Conflict Attributes,  Prev: Common Attributes,  Up: option attributes

7.5.5.3 Immediate Action Attributes
...................................

Certain options may need to be processed early.  For example, in order
to suppress the processing of configuration files, it is necessary to
process the command line option `--no-load-opts' *before* the config
files are processed.  To accommodate this, certain options may have
their enabled or disabled forms marked for immediate processing.  The
consequence of this is that they are processed ahead of all other
options in the reverse of normal order.

   Normally, the first options processed are the options specified in
the first `homerc' file, followed by then next `homerc' file through to
the end of config file processing.  Next, environment variables are
processed and finally, the command line options.  The later options
override settings processed earlier.  That actually gives them higher
priority.  Command line immediate action options actually have the
lowest priority of all.  They would be used only if they are to have an
effect on the processing of subsequent options.

`immediate'
     Use this option attribute to specify that the enabled form of the
     option is to be processed immediately.  The `help' and `more-help'
     options are so specified.  They will also call `exit()' upon
     completion, so they *do* have an effect on the processing of the
     remaining options :-).

`immed-disable'
     Use this option attribute to specify that the disabled form of the
     option is to be processed immediately.  The `load-opts' option is
     so specified.  The `--no-load-opts' command line option will
     suppress the processing of config files and environment variables.
     Contrariwise, the `--load-opts' command line option is processed
     normally.  That means that the options specified in that file will
     be processed after all the `homerc' files and, in fact, after
     options that precede it on the command line.

`also'
     If either the `immediate' or the `immed-disable' attributes are
     set to the string, "`also'", then the option will actually be
     processed twice:  first at the immediate processing phase and again
     at the "normal" time.

7.5.5.4 Option Conflict Attributes
..................................

These attributes may be used as many times as you need.  They are used
at the end of the option processing to verify that the context within
which each option is found does not conflict with the presence or
absence of other options.

   This is not a complete cover of all possible conflicts and
requirements, but it simple to implement and covers the more common
situations.

`flags-must'
     one entry for every option that *must* be present when this option
     is present

`flags-cant'
     one entry for every option that *cannot* be present when this
     option is present

7.5.5.5 Program may set option
..............................

If the option can be set outside of option processing, specify
"`settable'".  If this attribute is defined, special macros for setting
this particular option will be inserted into the interface file.  For
example, `TEMPL_DIRS' is a settable option for AutoGen, so a macro named
`SET_OPT_TEMPL_DIRS(a)' appears in the interface file.  This attribute
interacts with the DOCUMENTATION attribute.

7.5.5.6 Option cannot be pre-configured
.......................................

If presetting this option is not allowed, specify "`no-preset'".
(Thus, environment variables and values set in configuration files will
be ignored.)


File: autogen.info,  Node: opt-attr equivalence,  Next: opt-attr aliases,  Prev: opt-attr no-preset,  Up: option attributes

7.5.5.7 Option Equivalence Class
................................

Generally, when several options are mutually exclusive and basically
serve the purpose of selecting one of several processing modes, specify
the "`equivalence'" attribute.  These options will be considered an
equivalence class.  Sometimes, it is just easier to deal with them as
such.  All members of the equivalence class must contain the same
equivalenced-to option, including the equivalenced-to option itself.
Thus, it must be a class member.

   For an option equivalence class, there is a single occurrence
counter for the class.  It can be referenced with the interface macro,
`COUNT_OPT(BASE_OPTION)', where "BASE_OPTION" is the equivalenced-to
option name.

   Also, please take careful note: since the options are mapped to the
equivalenced-to option descriptor, any option argument values are
mapped to that descriptor also.  Be sure you know which "equivalent
option" was selected before getting an option argument value!

   During the presetting phase of option processing (*note Presetting
Options::), equivalenced options may be specified.  However, if
different equivalenced members are specified, only the last instance
will be recognized and the others will be discarded.  A conflict error
is indicated only when multiple different members appear on the command
line itself.

   As an example of where equivalenced options might be useful,
`cpio(1)' has three options `-o', `-i', and `-p' that define the
operational mode of the program (`create', `extract' and
`pass-through', respectively).  They form an equivalence class from
which one and only one member must appear on the command line.  If
`cpio' were an AutoOpt-ed program, then each of these option
definitions would contain:

    equivalence = create;

   and the program would be able to determine the operating mode with
code that worked something like this:

    switch (WHICH_IDX_CREATE) {
    case INDEX_OPT_CREATE:       ...
    case INDEX_OPT_EXTRACT:      ...
    case INDEX_OPT_PASS_THROUGH: ...
    default:    /* cannot happen */
    }

7.5.5.8 Option Aliasing
.......................

Sometimes, for backwards compatibility or tradition or just plain
convenience, it works better to define one option as a pure alias for
another option.  For such situations, provide the following pieces of
information:
    flag = {
       name  = aliasing-option-name;
       value = aliasing-flag-char; // optional !
       aliases = aliased-to-option;
    };
   Do not provide anything else.  The usage text for such an option
will be:
       This is an alias for aliased-to-option


File: autogen.info,  Node: opt-attr default option,  Next: opt-attr documentation,  Prev: opt-attr aliases,  Up: option attributes

7.5.5.9 Default Option
......................

If your program processes its arguments in named option mode (See
`long-opts' in *note program attributes::), then you may select *one*
of your options to be the default option.  Do so by using attribute
`default' with one of the options.  The option so specified must have
an `arg-type' (*note Option Arguments::) specified, but not the
`arg-optional' (*note arg-optional::) attribute.  That is to say, the
option argument must be required.

   If you have done this, then any arguments that do not match an
option name and do not contain an equal sign (`=') will be interpreted
as an option argument to the default option.


File: autogen.info,  Node: opt-attr documentation,  Next: opt-attr translators,  Prev: opt-attr default option,  Up: option attributes

7.5.5.10 Option Sectioning Comment
..................................

This attribute means the option exists for the purpose of separating
option description text in the usage output.  Libraries may choose to
make it settable so that the library can determine which command line
option is the first one that pertains to the library.

   If the "`documentation'" attribute is present, then all other
attributes are disabled except `settable', `call-proc' and `flag-code'.
`settable' must be and is only specified if `call-proc', `extract-code'
or `flag-code' has been specified.  When present, the `descrip'
attribute will be displayed only when the `--help' option has been
specified.  It will be displayed flush to the left hand margin and may
consist of one or more lines of text.  The name of the option will not
be printed.

   Documentation options are for clarifying the usage text and will not
usually appear in generated man pages or in the generated invoking
texinfo doc.  They may be gotten to appear in texinfo documents if the
`USAGE_NODES' environment variable is set to "doc".  In that case, the
invoking menu will have entries for these documentation flags, but not
the individual options.

7.5.5.11 Translator Notes
.........................

If you need to give the translators a special note about a particular
option, please use the "`translators'" attribute.  The attribute text
will be emitted into the generated `.c' text where the option related
strings get defined.  To make a general comment about all of the option
code, add comments to an `include' attribute (*note program
attributes::).  Do *not* use this attribute globally, or it will get
emitted into every option definition block.
