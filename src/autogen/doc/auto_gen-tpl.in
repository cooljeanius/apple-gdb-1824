@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up

This file documents AutoGen version [=`
  echo ${AG_REVISION}`=].  It is a tool designed
for generating program files that contain repetitive text with varied
substitutions.  This document is very long because it is intended as a
reference document.  For a quick start example, @xref{Example Usage}.

The AutoGen distribution includes the basic generator engine and
several add-on libraries and programs.  Of the most general interest
would be Automated Option processing, @xref{AutoOpts}, which also
includes stand-alone support for configuration file parsing, @xref{Features}.
Please see the ``Add-on packages for AutoGen'' section for additional
programs and libraries associated with AutoGen.

@node Directives
@section Controlling What Gets Processed
@cindex directives

Definition processing directives can @strong{only} be processed
if the '#' character is the first character on a line.  Also, if you
want a '#' as the first character of a line in one of your string
assignments, you should either escape it by preceding it with a
backslash @samp{\}, or by embedding it in the string as in @code{"\n#"}.

All of the normal C preprocessing directives are recognized, though
several are ignored.  There is also an additional @code{#shell} -
@code{#endshell} pair.  Another minor difference is that AutoGen
directives must have the hash character (@code{#}) in column 1.

The final tweak is that @code{#!} is treated as a comment line.
Using this feature, you can use:  @samp{#! /usr/local/bin/autogen}
as the first line of a definitions file, set the mode to executable
and "run" the definitions file as if it were a direct invocation of
AutoGen.  This was done for its hack value.

The ignored directives are:
[=

FOR directive       =][=

  (if (exist? "dummy")
      (string-downcase! (sprintf "@code{#%s}, " (get "name")))) =][=

ENDFOR directive    =]and @code{#if}.
Note that when ignoring the @code{#if} directive, all intervening
text through its matching @code{#endif} is also ignored,
including the @code{#else} clause.

The AutoGen directives that affect the processing of
definitions are:

@table @code[=
FOR directive "\n" =][=
  IF (exist? "text") =]
@item #[=% name (string-downcase! "%s") =][= % arg " %s" =]
@cindex #[=% name (string-downcase! "%s") =]
@cindex [=% name (string-downcase! "%s") =] directive
[= id-file =]

  ENDIF    =][=
ENDFOR directive=]
@end table
[=

INVOKE   get-text tag = COMMENTS

@node    Full Syntax
@section Finite State Machine Grammar

The preprocessing directives and comments are not part of the grammar.  They
are handled by the scanner/lexer.  The following was extracted directly from
the generated defParse-fsm.c source file.  The "EVT:" is the token seen,
the "STATE:" is the current state and the entries in this table describe
the next state and the action to take.  Invalid transitions were removed
from the table.

@node AutoGen Functions
@section AutoGen Scheme Functions

AutoGen uses Guile to interpret Scheme expressions within AutoGen
macros.  All of the normal Guile functions are available, plus several
extensions (@pxref{Common Functions}) have been added to
augment the repertoire of string manipulation functions and
manage the state of AutoGen processing.

This section describes those functions that are specific to AutoGen.
Please take note that these AutoGen specific functions are not loaded
and thus not made available until after the command line options have
been processed and the AutoGen definitions have been loaded.  They may,
of course, be used in Scheme functions that get defined at those times,
but they cannot be invoked.

@node SCM autogen-version
@subsection @file{autogen-version} - autogen version number
@findex autogen-version

This is a symbol defining the current AutoGen version number string.
It was first defined in AutoGen-5.2.14.
It is currently ``[= version =]''.

@node SCM c-file-line-fmt
@subsection format file info as, ``@code{#line nn "file"}''
@findex c-file-line-fmt

This is a symbol that can easily be used with the functions
@xref{SCM tpl-file-line}, and @xref{SCM def-file-line}.
These will emit C program @code{#line} directives pointing to template
and definitions text, respectively.

@node Common Functions
@section Common Scheme Functions

This section describes a number of general purpose functions that make
the kind of string processing that AutoGen does a little easier.
Unlike the AutoGen specific functions (@pxref{AutoGen Functions}),
these functions are available for direct use during definition load time.
The equality test (@pxref{SCM =}) is ``overloaded'' to do string equivalence
comparisons.  If you are looking for inequality, the Scheme/Lisp way
of spelling that is, ``(not (= ...))''.

@node AGMacro syntax
@subsection AutoGen Macro Syntax
@cindex macro syntax

The general syntax is:

@example
[ @{ <native-macro-name> | <user-defined-name> @} ] [ <arg> ... ]
@end example

@noindent
The syntax for @code{<arg>} depends on the particular macro,
but is generally a full expression (@pxref{expression syntax}).
Here are the exceptions to that general rule:

@enumerate
@item
@code{INVOKE} macros, implicit or explicit, must be followed by
a list of name/string value pairs.  The string values are
@i{simple expressions}, as described above.

That is, the @code{INVOKE} syntax is one of these two:
@example
<user-macro-name> [ <name> [ = <expression> ] ... ]

INVOKE <name-expression> [ <name> [ = <expression> ] ... ]
@end example

@item
AutoGen FOR macros must be in one of three forms:

@example
FOR <name> [ <separator-string> ]

FOR <name> (...Scheme expression list)

FOR <name> IN <string-entry> [ ... ]
@end example
@noindent
where:
@table @samp
@item <name>
must be a simple name.
@item <separator-string>
is inserted between copies of the enclosed block.  Do not try to use ``IN''
as your separator string.  It won't work.
@item <string-entry>
is an entry in a list of strings.  ``@code{<name>}'' is assigned
each value from the ``@code{IN}'' list before expanding the @code{FOR} block.
@item (...Scheme expression list)
is expected to contain one or more of the @code{for-from},
@code{for-to}, @code{for-by}, and @code{for-sep} functions.
(@xref{FOR}, and @ref{AutoGen Functions})
@end table

The first two forms iterate over the @code{FOR} block if @code{<name>}
is found in the AutoGen values.  The last form will create the AutoGen
value named @code{<name>}.

@item
AutoGen @code{DEFINE} macros must be followed by a simple name.
Anything after that is ignored.  Consequently, that ``comment space''
may be used to document any named values the macro expects to have
set up as arguments.  @xref{DEFINE}.

@item
The AutoGen @code{COMMENT}, @code{ELSE}, @code{ESAC} and the @code{END*}
macros take no arguments and ignore everything after the macro name
(e.g. see @ref{COMMENT})

@chapter Add-on packages for AutoGen

This chapter includes several programs that either work closely
with AutoGen (extracting definitions or providing special formatting
functions), or leverage off of AutoGen technology.  There is also
a formatting library that helps make AutoGen possible.

AutoOpts ought to appear in this list as well, but since it is
the primary reason why many people would even look into AutoGen
at all, I decided to leave it in the list of chapters.
