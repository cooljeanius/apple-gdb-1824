	This program was designed for the purpose of generating compact,
	columnized tables.  It will read a list of text items from standard
	in or a specified input file and produce a columnized listing of
	all the non-blank lines.  Leading white space on each line is
	preserved, but trailing white space is stripped.  Methods of
	applying per-entry and per-line embellishments are provided.
	See the formatting and separation arguments below.

	This program is used by AutoGen to help clean up and organize
	its output.

	See @file{autogen/agen5/fsm.tpl} and the generated output
	@file{pseudo-fsm.h}.

	This function was not implemented as an expression function because
	either it would have to be many expression functions, or a provision
	would have to be added to provide options to expression functions.
	Maybe not a bad idea, but it is not being implemented at the moment.

	A side benefit is that you can use it outside of @code{autogen} to
	columnize input, a la the @code{ls} command.
