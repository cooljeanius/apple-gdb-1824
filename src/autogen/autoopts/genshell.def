explain =<<- _EOF_
	Note that @code{shell} is only useful if the output file does not
	already exist.  If it does, then the shell name and optional first
	argument will be extracted from the script file.

detail =<<- _EOF_
	If the script file already exists and contains Automated Option
	Processing text, the second line of the file through the ending tag
	will be replaced by the newly generated text.  The first @code{#!}
	line will be regenerated.
