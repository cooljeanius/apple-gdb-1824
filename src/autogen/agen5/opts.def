	The AutoGen define names are used for the following purposes:

	@enumerate
	@item
	Sections of the AutoGen definitions may be enabled or disabled
	by using C-style #ifdef and #ifndef directives.
	@item
	When defining a value for a name, you may specify the index
	for a particular value.  That index may be a literal value,
	a define option or a value #define-d in the definitions themselves.
	@item
	The name of a file may be prefixed with @code{$NAME/}.
	The @code{$NAME} part of the name string will be replaced with
	the define-d value for @code{NAME}.
	@item
	When AutoGen is finished loading the definitions, the defined values
	are exported to the environment with, @code{putenv(3)}.
	These values can then be used in shell scripts with @code{$@{NAME@}}
	references and in templates with @code{(getenv "NAME")}.
	@item
	While processing a template, you may specify an index to retrieve
	a specific value.  That index may also be a define-d value.
	@end enumerate

	It is entirely equivalent to place this name in the exported environment.
	Internally, that is what AutoGen actually does with this option.

	This option behaves fairly closely to the way the @code{-M} series of
	options work with the gcc compiler, except that instead of just
	emitting the predecessor dependencies, this also emits the successor
	dependencies (output target files).  By default, the output dependency
	information will be placed in @code{<base-name>.d}, but may also be
	specified with @code{-MF<file>}.  The time stamp on this file will be
	manipulated so that it will be one second older than the oldest
	primary output file.

	The target in this dependency file will normally be the dependency
	file name, but may also be overridden with @code{-MT<targ-name>}.
	AutoGen will not alter the contents of that file, but it may create
	it and it will adjust the modification time to match the start time.

	@strong{NB:} these second letters are part of the option argument, so
	@code{-MF <file>} must have the space character quoted or omitted, and
	@code{-M "F <file>"} is acceptable because the @code{F} is part of the
	option argument.

	@code{-M} may be followed by any of the letters M, F, P, T, Q, D, or
	G.  However, only F and T are meaningful and the latter has a somewhat
	different meaning: @code{-MT<name>} is interpreted as meaning
	@code{<name>} is a sentinel file that will depend on all inputs
	(templates and definition files) and all the output files will depend
	on this sentinel file.  It is suitable for use as a real make target.

	This is the recommended usage:
	@example
	-MFwhatever-you-like.dep -MTyour-sentinel-file
	@end example
	and then in your @code{Makefile}, make the @file{autogen} rule:
	@example
	-include whatever-you-like.dep
	your-sentinel-file:
	    autogen -MT$@@ -MF$*.d .....
	@end example

	The modification time on the dependency file is adjusted to be one
	second before the earliest time stamp of any other output file.
	Consequently, it is suitable for use as the sentinel file testifying
	to the fact the program was successfully run.  (@code{-include} is
	the GNU make way of specifying "include it if it exists".  Your make
	must support that feature or your bootstrap process must create the
	file.)

	All of this may also be specified using the @code{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT}
	or @code{AUTOGEN_MAKE_DEP} environment variables.  If defined,
	dependency information will be output.  If defined with white space
	free text that is something other than @code{true}, @code{false},
	@code{yes}, @code{no}, @code{0} or @code{1}, then the string is taken
	to be an output file name.  If it contains a string of white space
	characters, the first token is as above and the second token is taken
	to be the target (sentinel) file as @code{-MT} in the paragraphs
	above.  @code{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT} will be ignored if there are
	multiple sequences of white space characters or if its contents are,
	specifically, @code{false}, @code{no} or @code{0}.

	The definitions (@code{<def-file>}) can be specified with the
	@code{definitions} option or as the command argument, but not both.
	Omitting it or specifying @code{-} will result in reading definitions
	from standard input.

	The output file names are based on the template, but generally use the
	base name of the definition file.  If standard in is read for the
	definitions, then @code{stdin} will be used for that base name.  The
	suffixes to the base name are gotten from the template.  However, the
	template file may specify the entire output file name.  The generated
	files are always created in the current directory.  If you need to
	place output in an alternate directory, @code{cd} to that directory and
	use the @code{--templ_dirs} option to search the original directory.

	@code{loop-limit} is used in debugging to stop runaway expansions.

	@code{AutoGen} is designed for generating program files that contain
	repetitive text with varied substitutions.  The goal is to simplify the
	maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
	This is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text
	that must be kept synchronized.

	One common example is the problem of maintaining the code required for
	processing program options.  Processing options requires a minimum of
	four different constructs be kept in proper order in different places
	in your program.  You need at least: The flag character in the flag
	string, code to process the flag when it is encountered, a global
	state variable or two, and a line in the usage text.
	You will need more things besides this if you choose to implement
	long option names, configuration file processing, environment variables
	and so on.

	All of this can be done mechanically; with the proper templates
	and this program.

	Here is how the man page is produced:
	@example
	autogen -Tagman-cmd.tpl -MFman-dep -MTstamp-man opts.def
	@end example

	This command produced this man page from the AutoGen option definition
	file.  It overrides the template specified in @file{opts.def} (normally
	@file{options.tpl}) and uses @file{agman-cmd.tpl}.  It also sets the
	make file dependency output to @file{man-dep} and the sentinel file
	(time stamp file) to @file{man-stamp}.  The base of the file name is
	derived from the defined @code{prog-name}.

	The texi invocation document is produced via:

	autogen -Tagtexi-cmd.tpl -MFtexi-dep -MTtexi-stamp opts.def
