AutoGen would not be what it is without the invaluable help of
many people:

Everybody who was kind enough to spend time testing it,
using it with the GCC fixincludes and reporting bugs.

The following people made especially gracious contributions of their
time and energy in helping to track down bugs, port to new systems,
and generally assist in the maintainership process:

Gary V. Vaughan <gary@gnu.org>
Robert Lipe <robertlipe@usa.net>
Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>
James R. Van Zandt <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com>
Thomas Steudten <Steudten@users.sourceforge.net>
Your name could go here if you help us fix bugs!
