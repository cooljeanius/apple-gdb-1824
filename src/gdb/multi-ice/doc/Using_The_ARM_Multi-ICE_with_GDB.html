<h1>Using the ARM Multi-ICE with GDB</h1>
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For some time now, Red Hat has been in possession of a program named the
<tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt>, which allows GDB to communicate with
the <a href="http://www.arm.com/devtools/multi_ice?OpenDocument">ARM 
Multi-ICE</a> JTAG emulator. </p>

<p>However a legal issue prevented the software being released. Recently though,
<a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a> were kind enough to release a GPL
friendly version of the ARM RDI headers. This has allowed Red Hat to
release the sources to the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt>. </p>

<p>The server should work with both the 1.x and 2.x versions of the ARM
Multi-ICE.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The only supported host is Windows.</p>

<h2>Legal status</h2>

<p>As explained in great detail in the GNU General Public Licence, this
software is supplied without warranty or guarantee of any kind. This
software makes use of Dynamically Linked Libraries on Windows, to which
the source code is not available. This is a known grey area of the GPL.
</p>

<p><b>Neither Red Hat Inc. nor ARM Ltd. may be held responsible for the
obligations that the use of this software puts on you, under the terms
of the GNU General Public Licence.</b> It is your responsibility to comply
with the terms of the licence.</p>

<p>It is considered likely that under the terms of the GPL it would be a
breach of the GPL to distribute this software in binary form. Hence it is
provided here on an as-is basis in source form only.</p>

<h2>Downloading software for building the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt></h2>

<p>To build the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt> you must first download and
install several pieces of software. Most obviously you must obtain a copy
of <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">GDB</a>, and
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> on which it depends. At this
point you should download and install Cygwin, and download GDB, but not try
to install it.</p>

<p>You must also have installed the ARM Multi-ICE server software that came
supplied with the Multi-ICE unit.</a></p>

<p>Next, you should download the RDI 1.5.1 distribution from
<a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a>. The download is available
<a href="http://www.arm.com/support/downloads/info/5570.html">from this
page</a>. You should
download and install the package in an appropriate location.</p>

<p>Finally, you should download the
<a href="ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/multi-ice-gdb.tar.gz">
<tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt> sources</a>.</p>

<h2>Preparing to build the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt></h2>

<p>Open a Cygwin bash shell window, create a directory to contain
the sources and build directory, and change into it, e.g.:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ mkdir /tmp/migdb
  bash-2.04$ cd /tmp/migdb
</pre></p>
<p>Unarchive the GDB sources, e.g. for GDB 5.1.1, assuming the .tar.gz file
had been saved to <tt>C:\</tt>:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ tar -zxvf /cygdrive/c/gdb-5.1.1.tar.gz
</pre></p>
<p>Create a GDB multi-ice source directory and unarchive the 
<tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt> sources, e.g. assuming the multi-ice-gdb-server
sources were saved to <tt>C:\</tt>:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ cd gdb-5.1.1/gdb
  bash-2.04$ mkdir multi-ice
  bash-2.04$ cd multi-ice
  bash-2.04$ tar -zxvf /cygdrive/c/multi-ice-gdb.tar.gz
</pre></p>
<p>Create a directory for building, and change to it, e.g.:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ mkdir /tmp/migdb/build
  bash-2.04$ cd /tmp/migdb/build
</pre></p>

<h2>Building the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt></h2>

<p>First configure the sources, e.g.:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ /tmp/migdb/gdb-5.1.1/configure -v --target arm-elf --enable-multi-ice 2>&1 | tee configure.out
</pre>
which should produce a lot of output. The configure.out file contains a copy
of the output for further diagnosis if something goes wrong.</p>
<p> If you want to build all of GDB as well, at this point type:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ make -w all install 2>&1 | tee make.out
</pre>
which will build and install everything into the default install location
( /usr/local/bin ). If you wish to install to a different location you
should configure the sources with a different prefix. Read the GDB manual on
how to do this.</p>
<p>Alternatively to only build the minimum required for the
<tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt>, type:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ make -w all-libiberty all-bfd 2>&1 | tee make.out
</pre></p>
<p>Finally to build the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt> itself, change
to the multi-ice build directory and type make, supplying the make
variables MULTI_ICE_INCLUDES which should point to the location of the ARM
RDI 1.5 headers, and MULTI_ICE_LIBS which should point to the location of
the ARM Multi-ICE server directory, as well as the location of the GDB
multi-ice directory. For example:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ cd gdb/multi-ice
  bash-2.04$ make -w MULTI_ICE_INCLUDES="-I/cygdrive/c/Rdi/Headers" \
    MULTI_ICE_LIBS="-L/cygdrive/c/Multi-ICE -L/tmp/migdb/gdb-5.1.1/gdb/multi-ice -ltoolconf" 2>&1 | tee make.out
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> There may be a large number of warnings.</p>
<p>At this point the build of the multi-ice-gdb-server should be complete.
As it needs access to the Multi-ICE.dll file, it is probably easiest to
copy it straight alongside the ARM Multi-ICE server software:
<pre>
  bash-2.04$ cp -i multi-ice-gdb-server.exe /cygdrive/c/Multi-ICE
  bash-2.04$ cp -i /tmp/migdb/gdb-5.1.1/gdb/multi-ice/*.dll /cygdrive/c/Multi-ICE
</pre></p>

<h2>Running the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt></h2>

<h3>Connecting to the Multi-ICE server software</h3>

<ol>
<li><i>Start the ARM Multi-ICE server software:</i>

<p>Start the ARM Multi-ICE server software from the Windows Start menu on
the host computer. You will need to set up a Multi-ICE Server configuration
file for your hardware. Ensure the
board is reset and awakened (if applicable) before trying to make a
connection. Use the Multi-ICE server graphical interface to load the
configuration file. Once the Multi-ICE server is happy talking to the
hardware, the hardware graphic will indicate the processor core model
connected to in green.</p>

<p>Note that certain targets may require jumper modifications, or re-soldered
connections. For more details, see the ARM Multi-ICE User Guide.</p></li>

<li><i>Start the `multi-ice-gdb-server' software</i>
<p>Open a DOS window or a bash shell and start the <tt>multi-ice-gdb-server</tt>
software on the host computer. If starting a DOS window, ensure the Cygwin
DLL is also on your PATH.
<pre>
C:\> multi-ice-gdb-server.exe --remote-port 9000 --byte-sex l --config-dialog
</pre></p></li>

<li><i>Changing the default MultiICE settings:</i>

<p>It is probably not necessary to change the settings from the command-line
given in step 2. But if your configuration has special requirements, you can
configure the connection both to the Multi-ICE Interface Unit and to the
remote GDB. The connection to the Multi-ICE Interface Unit can be configured
with the ARM Multi-ICE server. The configuration of the remote GDB can be
configured by passing arguments to the Multi-ICE GDB server.</p>

<p>In the command-line given in step 2, the options are interpreted as follows:
<ul>

<li>"<tt>--remote-port 9000</tt>" specifies the TCP port that GDB clients use to connect
to this server. You can use any available port.</li>

<li>"<tt>--byte-sex l</tt>" tells GDB what endian-ness to respond with. Some GDB
responses are byte-order (endian-ness) sensitive. The default is to attempt
to determine the endianness from the target.</li>

<li>"<tt>--config-dialog</tt>" forces the GDB server to bring up the Multi-ICE
configuration dialog when starting. This is required in order to force the
Multi-ICE server to connect properly.</li></ul></p>

<p>Other available options include:
<ul>
<li>"<tt>--debug</tt>": setting this turns on GDB protocol tracing - analagous to the GDB
command `set remotedebug 1'</li>

<li>"<tt>--rdi-logging</tt>": setting this turns on logging at the RDI level</li>

<li>"<tt>--target-port &lt;port></tt>": If the target is ID sensitive (the Multi-ICE can
actually work with multiple devices simultaneously, each with their own ID),
it may be specified with this option.</li>

<li>"<tt>--stop-others</tt>": setting this specifies that a resume stops all
the other processors</li>

<li>"<tt>--help</tt>": produces help output.</li></ul></p></li>

<li><i>Test the remote connection:</i>

<p>Run gdb on the development computer by typing the command `arm-elf-gdb
&lt;executable>' where `&lt;executable>' is the program to download and debug.
Connect to the Multi-ICE GDB server by typing the command: `target remote
&lt;hostname:port>',  where `&lt;hostname>' is the IP address/hostname of the host
computer and `&lt;port>' is the remote port number, 9000 in the above example
and 2331 by default. For example, if the host and development computer are
the same, type `target remote localhost:9000'. You can then use GDB debugger
commands normally.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Only one remote GDB can connect to the GDB Multi-ICE server at the
same time. When you quit the remote GDB, or issue the `disconnect' command,
the connection to the GDB Multi-ICE server is dropped and the connection is
available to another remote GDB. If you attempt to make a second connection
while one connection is already established, no error message is generated;
the second connection attempt will just time out.</p>
        </li></ol>

<h3>eCos Thread debugging using Multi-ICE</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> This functionality will not be available until eCos 2.0.</p>

<p>Normally, the Multi-ICE (and the Multi-ICE GDB server) have no knowledge of
threads which might be running on the target hardware. In the case of an
eCos application, some additional support is provided. If the eCos program
has been built with the "CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_ICE_THREAD_SUPPORT" option enabled
(found in the eCos Configuration Tool under the ARM architecture-specific
flags), then the Multi-ICE GDB server and the eCos application co-operate to
provide the thread information.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> It is also required that the following options are also enabled:
<ul>
<li>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS</li>
<li>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT</li>
<li>CYGDBG_KERNEL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT</li></ul></p>

<p>When an eCos program is built with these options, then the server will call
into the program in order to obtain thread information. This can take place
at any time and does not require any explicit action on the eCos application
side other than being compiled with the appropriate options enabled. The GDB
requests are made as anonymous function calls run transparently behind the
scenes as far as the running eCos program is concerned.</p>
