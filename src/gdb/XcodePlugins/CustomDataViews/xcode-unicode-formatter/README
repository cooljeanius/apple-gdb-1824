This is a simple XCode data viewer plugin, based on some Apple sample code.

It is intended to allow you to view the content of 16-bit and or 32-bit unicode strings in XCode.

The 16-bit support is handy if you're using cross-platform code which treats "unicode" strings as utf-16 or UCS2 strings.

The 32-bit support is handy if you're dealing with unix-style code which passes around 32-bit wchar_t based strings.
