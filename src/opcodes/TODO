FIXME: I may have broken this directory in the same way I broke ../bfd;
may possibly still need to fix this one similarly... see bug #6 on GitHub:
https://github.com/cooljeanius/apple-gdb-1824/issues/6
Also, I'll need to figure out how to regenerate files with cgen properly
if I'm ever going to silence warnings from cgen-created files for bug #9:
https://github.com/cooljeanius/apple-gdb-1824/issues/9
